'1:6': '[a]If anyone is [b]unreprovable, the [1]husband of one wife, having believing children not accused of [c]dissoluteness or [d]unruly.',
'1:7': 'For the [1a]overseer must be unreprovable as a [b]steward of God, not [c]self-willed, [2]not quick tempered, [3]not an excessive drinker, [4]not a striker, [5]not greedy for base gain;',
'1:8': 'But [1]hospitable, a [a]lover of good, [2]of a sober mind, righteous, [3]holy, self-controlled;',

'1:10': 'For there are many [a]unruly men, [b]vain talkers and [c]deceivers, especially [1d]those of the circumcision,',
'1:11': 'Whose mouths must be [1]stopped, who overthrow whole [a]households, teaching [b]things [2c]for the sake of base gain, which they ought not to do.',
'1:12': 'One from among [1]themselves, a [2a]prophet of their own, said, [b]Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle [3]gluttons.',
'1:13': 'This testimony is true; for which cause [1a]reprove them [2b]severely that they may be [3c]healthy in the [4]faith,',

'3:2': 'To [a]slander no one, to be [1b]uncontentious, [2c]gentle, showing all [d]meekness toward all men.',
'3:3': 'For we also [1]were [a]once foolish, [b]disobedient, [c]deceived, serving as [d]slaves [e]various [2]lusts and [f]pleasures, spending our lives in [g]malice and [h]envy, hateful, hating one another.',
'3:4': 'But when the [1a]kindness and the [b]love to man of our [c]Savior God [d]appeared,',
'3:5': 'Not out of [1a]works in [b]righteousness which we did but according to His [2c]mercy He [d]saved us, through the [3e]washing of [4f]regeneration and the [g]renewing of the [5]Holy [h]Spirit,',

'3:8': '[a]Faithful is [1]the word, and concerning [2]these things I desire you to [3b]confidently affirm, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to maintain [c]respectable works. These things are good and profitable to men.',
'3:9': 'But [1a]avoid foolish [2b]questionings and [3c]genealogies and [4d]strifes and [5e]contentions about the [6f]law, for they are [g]unprofitable and [7h]vain.',
'3:10': 'A [1a]factious man, after a first and second [b]admonition, [2c]refuse,',
'3:11': 'Knowing that such a one is [1]perverted and is [a]sinning, though he is condemned by his own self.',

Faith is a proclamation that we are unable to fulfill God&rsquo;s requirements but that God has done everything for us and that we receive what He has done. The life promised by God is what we have received of Him for the carrying out of His demand. It was in this way that Paul was an apostle to administrate God&rsquo;s New Testament economy."]},

{sup:"1a", word:"hope", vrefs:"Titus 3:7", lines:["Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith and the knowledge of the truth but also in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised in eternity. This corresponds with according to the promise of life in {2Ti1:1|2&nbsp;Tim. 1:1}. In the hope of eternal life means on the basis of, on the condition of, relying on the hope of, eternal life. Eternal life, the uncreated life of God, is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today but also for us to inherit ({Mat19:29|Matt. 19:29}) in its full extent for eternity. Today&rsquo;s experience of eternal life qualifies us to inherit it in the future. The enjoyment of eternal life today is a foretaste; the inheritance of eternal life in the coming age and in eternity will be the full taste. This inheritance is the hope of eternal life (see {Tit3:7^3|note 7<sup>3</sup>} in {Tit3|ch. 3}). This is the blessed hope revealed in {Tit2:13|2:13}, composed of the freedom of the glory of full sonship, the redemption of our body ({Rom8:21|Rom. 8:21}-{Rom8:25|25}), the salvation to be revealed at the last time ({1Pe1:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:5}), and the living hope of the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance kept in the heavens for us ({1Pe1:3|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3}-{1Pe1:4|4}). This is the full, spiritual, divine, and heavenly blessing and enjoyment of eternal life, both in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth ({2Pe1:11|2&nbsp;Pet. 1:11}; {2Pe3:13|3:13}; {Rev21:6|Rev. 21:6}-{Rev21:7|7}), referred to in {1Ti4:8|1&nbsp;Tim. 4:8}. Paul assumed his apostleship and accomplished his apostolic ministry not based on any benefit in the present life, nor taking the privilege of the law as a condition, but based on this hope as a condition, indicating that for his apostleship he relied on and trusted in the divine life with all its hope, which God promised in eternity and which was brought to us through the gospel ({2Ti1:10|2&nbsp;Tim. 1:10}).","This Epistle concerns the maintaining of order in the churches. For this, the faith of God&rsquo;s chosen ones, the truth according to godliness, and eternal life are indispensable. Hence, in the very opening word these three things are set forth."]},

It is in the element and operation of this faith that the saints who were one with the Lord in His concern loved the suffering and faithful apostle.","Faith and love are two inseparable, excellent virtues of the believers in Christ. Faith is given to us by God ({2Pe1:1^5|note 1<sup>5</sup>} in {2Pe1|2&nbsp;Pet. 1}) that by it we may receive Christ ({Joh1:12|John 1:12}), the embodiment of the Triune God ({Col2:9|Col. 2:9}), and thereby enter into the Triune God and be joined to Him as one, having Him as our life, life supply, and everything. Love issues out of such a wonderful faith and enables us to live out all the riches of the Triune God in Christ with those who have believed into Christ with us, that the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;may have a glorious expression. Faith is for appreciating, substantiating, and receiving the unlimited riches of the Triune God; love is for experiencing, enjoying, and living out the immeasurably rich Triune God. Faith is for the believers to be joined to the Triune God, who is everything to them; love is for the believers to minister and transmit the Triune God to their fellow believers so that, in such a wonderful and powerful faith, all the believers may love one another with divine, transcendent love and live a corporate life in Christ. In this way the Body of Christ is realized and the processed Triune God is expressed today on the earth in the all-inclusive Christ through the immeasurable life-giving Spirit.","The Epistle to Titus is the conclusion of the three books, 1 and 2&nbsp;Timothy and Titus, and it concludes with the wonderful faith and the super-excellent love. This implies that, in the current of the church&rsquo;s degradation, in order to be able to effectively stand firm and overcome the downward trend and factor in the church, this wonderful faith and this super-excellent love are indispensable. We should not walk by sight or care for the outward situation. Rather, in this wonderful faith we should enjoy its source, which is the Triune God, to whom we have been joined through this faith, and by this super-excellent love of the Triune God we should love Him and all those who belong to Him. Only in this way can we become, in the current of the church&rsquo;s degradation, the overcomers whom the Lord is calling and is desiring to obtain in {Rev2|Revelation 2} and {Rev3|3}.","This wonderful faith and this super-excellent love are out of the Triune God, who earnestly desires to be joined to us to be our everything. This Triune God passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection from the dead, and ascension to the heavens on high and was ultimately consummated as the life-giving Spirit ({1Co15:45|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45}). This Spirit of life ({Rom8:2|Rom. 8:2}), who includes divinity, humanity, and Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension and is the reality of the all-inclusive Christ ({Joh14:16|John 14:16}-{Joh14:20|20}), dwells in our regenerated spirit ({Rom8:16|Rom. 8:16}; {2Ti4:22|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22}). When we contact this Triune God through prayer and by looking to Him, by means of our spirit, which was once dead and was made alive, He infuses Himself into us in many ways to become the faith within us toward Him and the love outside of us toward those who belong to Him. Such faith and such love are the reality and expression ({1Jo4:8|1&nbsp;John 4:8}, {1Jo4:16|16}) of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;in whom we believe and whom we worship and receive. Also, they are the rich grace given to us in Christ by the Triune God ({1Ti1:14|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:14}), not only to be the motivating power and expression of our spiritual life but also to become our breastplate ({1Th5:8|1&nbsp;Thes. 5:8}), which covers and protects the vital parts of our being. It is by such faith that we receive and enjoy the divine life that is revealed and ministered to us in the entire Gospel of John ({Joh3:16|John 3:16}, {Joh3:36|36}), and it is by such love that we love the Lord and those who belong to Him ({Joh21:15|John 21:15}-{Joh21:17|17}; {Joh13:34|13:34}-{Joh13:35|35}). Such faith and love are connected and go together: love comes from faith, and faith operates and works through love ({Gal5:6|Gal. 5:6}). Love with faith enables us to love our Lord in incorruptibility so that we may have an overcoming church life ({Eph6:23|Eph. 6:23}-{Eph6:24|24}) for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Christ for the church. Therefore, it is in this faith that we are well pleasing to God ({Heb11:6|Heb. 11:6}) and in this love that we are blessed of the Lord ({1Co16:22|1&nbsp;Cor. 16:22}). May this love with this faith be to the brothers from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ ({Eph6:23|Eph. 6:23})."]},
