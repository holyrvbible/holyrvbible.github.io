verses: {
'1:1': 'The [a]vision of [1]Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of [b]Uzziah, [c]Jotham, [d]Ahaz, and [e]Hezekiah, the kings of Judah:',
'1:2': '[a]Hear, O heavens, and hearken, O earth,<br>For Jehovah has spoken:<br>I have brought up [1b]children, and I have raised them;<br>And yet they have rebelled against Me.',
'1:3': 'The ox knows his owner,<br>And the donkey, his master&rsquo;s manger;<br>But Israel does [a]not know,<br>My people do not much consider.',
'1:4': 'Alas, sinful nation,<br>A people heavy with iniquity,<br>[a]Seed of evildoers,<br>Children acting corruptly!<br>They have forsaken Jehovah;<br>They have despised the Holy One of Israel;<br>They have become estranged and have gone backward.',
'1:5': '[1]Where will you be stricken again?<br>Will you continue your [2]apostasy?<br>The whole head has become sick,<br>And the whole heart faint;',
'1:6': 'From the sole of the foot even to the head,<br>There is no soundness in it,<br>Only bruises and blows<br>And raw wounds&mdash;<br>They have not been pressed out nor [a]bound up<br>Nor softened with oil.',
'1:7': 'Your land is a desolation;<br>Your cities are burned with fire;<br>Your field&mdash;in your sight<br>Strangers devour it;<br>It is a desolation, like something overthrown by strangers.',
'1:8': 'And the [a]daughter of Zion is left<br>Like a booth in a vineyard,<br>Like a hut in a cucumber field,<br>Like a besieged city.',
'1:9': '[a]Unless Jehovah [1]of hosts<br>Had left to us a surviving few,<br>We would have been like [b]Sodom,<br>We would have resembled Gomorrah.',
'1:10': 'Hear the word of Jehovah,<br>You rulers of Sodom;<br>Hearken to the instruction of our God,<br>You people of Gomorrah.',
'1:11': 'What is the multitude of your [a]sacrifices to Me?<br>Says Jehovah.<br>I have had My fill of burnt offerings of rams<br>And the fat of fed cattle;<br>The blood of bulls and lambs<br>And goats, I do not delight in.',
'1:12': 'When you come to [a]appear before Me,<br>Who has required this of your hand,<br>To trample My courts?',
'1:13': 'Bring no more vain offerings;<br>Incense is an abomination to Me.<br>New moon and Sabbath, the calling of convocations&mdash;<br>I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn assembly.',
'1:14': 'Your new moons and your appointed feasts<br>My soul [a]hates;<br>They have become a burden on Me;<br>I am weary of bearing them.',
'1:15': 'Thus, when you spread forth your [a]hands,<br>I will hide My eyes from you;<br>Even though you multiply your prayers,<br>I will not hear.<br>Your hands are full of [b]blood;',
'1:16': '[1a]Wash yourselves; cleanse yourselves.<br>Turn away the evil of your deeds<br>From before My eyes.<br>Cease doing what is [b]evil;',
'1:17': 'Learn to do good.<br>Seek justice;<br>Correct the ruthless.<br>Defend the [a]orphan;<br>Plead for the widow.',
'1:18': 'Come now and let us reason together,<br>Says Jehovah.<br>Though your sins are like scarlet,<br>They will be as [a]white as [1]snow;<br>Though they are as red as crimson,<br>They will be like [1]wool.',
'1:19': 'If you are willing and listen,<br>You will eat the good of the land;',
'1:20': 'But if you refuse and rebel,<br>You will be devoured by the sword;<br>For the mouth of Jehovah has spoken.',
'1:21': 'How the faithful city<br>Has become a [a]harlot!<br>She who was full of justice,<br>She in whom righteousness once lodged,<br>But now murderers!',
'1:22': 'Your silver has become dross;<br>Your wine diluted with water;',
'1:23': 'Your rulers are rebellious<br>And companions of thieves;<br>They all love bribes<br>And chase after rewards;<br>They do not defend the orphan,<br>Nor does the widow&rsquo;s plea come before them.',
'1:24': 'Hence, the Lord Jehovah of hosts,<br>The Mighty One of Israel, declares:<br>Ah, I will ease Myself of My [1]adversaries,<br>And I will avenge Myself of My [1]enemies;',
'1:25': 'And I will turn My hand against you.<br>I will thoroughly [a]purge away your dross as with lye,<br>And I will remove all your alloy.',
'1:26': 'And I will restore your judges as at the first<br>And your counselors as at the beginning.<br>Afterward you will be called the city of righteousness,<br>The faithful city.',
'1:27': 'Zion will be ransomed with justice,<br>And her returning ones with righteousness.',
'1:28': 'And there will be the shattering of rebels and sinners together,<br>And those who forsake Jehovah will meet their end.',
'1:29': 'For [1]you will be ashamed of the [2]terebinths<br>That you have taken pleasure in;<br>And you will be embarrassed at the gardens<br>That you have chosen.',
'1:30': 'For you will be like a terebinth<br>Whose leaves are falling,<br>And like a garden<br>In which there is no water;',
'1:31': 'And the strong man will become [1]tow,<br>And his work a spark;<br>And they will both burn together,<br>And there will be none to extinguish them.',
'2:1': 'The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem:',
'2:2': '[a]But in the [b]last days<br>The [1c]mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established<br>On the top of the mountains;<br>And it will be lifted up above the hills;<br>And all the [d]nations will stream to it,',
'2:3': 'And many peoples will come and say,<br>[a]Come and let us go up to the [b]mountain of Jehovah,<br>To the house of the God of Jacob,<br>That He may instruct us [1]in His ways,<br>And that we may walk in His paths.<br>For from Zion will go forth [2]instruction,<br>And the word of Jehovah from [c]Jerusalem;',
'2:4': 'And He will [1]judge between the nations,<br>And will decide matters for many peoples.<br>[a]And they will beat their swords into plowshares,<br>And their spears into pruning knives;<br>Nation will not lift up sword against nation,<br>Nor will they learn [b]war anymore.',
'2:5': 'House of Jacob, come and let us [a]walk in the light of Jehovah.',
'2:6': 'For You have abandoned Your people,<br>The house of Jacob;<br>Because they are full of customs from the east,<br>And they are soothsayers like the Philistines,<br>And they clasp hands with the children of foreigners.',
'2:7': 'Their land is full of [1]silver and gold,<br>And their treasures are limitless;<br>Their land is also full of horses,<br>And their chariots are limitless.',
'2:8': 'And their land is [a]full of idols;<br>They bow down to the work of their hands,<br>To that which their fingers have made.',
'2:9': 'Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased&mdash;<br>But do not forgive them.',
'2:10': 'Enter into the [a]rock,<br>And hide in the dust,<br>From the dread of Jehovah,<br>And from the splendor of His majesty.',
'2:11': 'Man&rsquo;s [1a]haughty look will be abased,<br>And the loftiness of men will be humbled;<br>But Jehovah alone will be exalted<br>In that day.',
'2:12': 'For Jehovah of hosts will have a [1]day<br>Over everything proud and lofty,<br>And over everything lifted up that it may be abased;',
'2:13': 'Over all the [1]cedars of Lebanon,<br>Which are lofty and lifted up,<br>And over all the [1]oaks of Bashan;',
'2:14': 'Over all the [1]lofty mountains,<br>And over all the [1]hills that are lifted up;',
'2:15': 'Over every high tower,<br>And over every fortified wall;',
'2:16': 'Over all the ships of Tarshish,<br>And over all their pleasant [1]artifacts.',
'2:17': 'And the [a]haughtiness of the ordinary man will be humbled,<br>And the loftiness of the men of distinction will be abased;<br>But Jehovah alone will be exalted<br>In that day.',
'2:18': 'And the idols will vanish completely.',
'2:19': 'And men will go into caves in the [a]rocks<br>And into holes in the dust,<br>From the dread of Jehovah,<br>And from the splendor of His majesty,<br>When He arises to make the earth tremble.',
'2:20': 'In that day a man will cast<br>His idols of silver and his idols of gold,<br>Which they made for themselves to bow down to,<br>To the moles and to the bats,',
'2:21': 'So that they may go into the crevices of the rocks<br>And into the clefts of the cliffs,<br>From the dread of Jehovah,<br>And from the splendor of His majesty,<br>When He arises to make the earth tremble.',
'2:22': 'Stop regarding man,<br>Whose life breath is in his nostrils.<br>For of what value is he considered to be?',
'3:1': 'For now the Lord Jehovah of hosts<br>Is [a]taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah<br>Every kind of support&mdash;<br>All the support of bread<br>And all the support of water;',
'3:2': 'The mighty man and the man of war,<br>The judge and the prophet,<br>And the diviner and the elder;',
'3:3': 'The captain of fifty and the highly regarded;<br>And the counselor, the wise magician, and the knowledgeable enchanter.',
'3:4': 'And I will make [a]youths their rulers,<br>And capriciousness will rule over them.',
'3:5': 'And the people will be oppressed, each by the other,<br>And each by his neighbor.<br>The youth will be arrogant to the elder,<br>And the contemned one to the one who is honored.',
'3:6': 'When a man takes hold of his brother<br>In his father&rsquo;s house and says,<br>You have clothing, you be our ruler,<br>And these ruins will be under your hand;',
'3:7': 'He will solemnly say,<br>I will not be the one who binds your wounds,<br>For in my house there is no [1]food or clothing;<br>Do not appoint me as [1]ruler of the people.',
'3:8': 'For Jerusalem stumbles,<br>And Judah falls,<br>Because their speech and their actions are against Jehovah,<br>To rebel against the eyes of His glory.',
'3:9': 'The countenance of their faces witnesses against them,<br>And they declare their sin like [a]Sodom;<br>They do not hide it.<br>Woe to their soul!<br>For they have brought evil upon themselves.',
'3:10': 'Say to the righteous that it will go well with them,<br>For they will eat the fruit of their actions.',
'3:11': 'Woe to the wicked man! It will go badly with him;<br>For the result of his deeds will be done to him',
'3:12': 'My people&mdash;their oppressors are children,<br>And women rule over them.<br>O My people, those who lead you are leading you astray;<br>And the path for your ways they have hidden.',
'3:13': 'Jehovah stands firm to contend,<br>And He stands to judge the people.',
'3:14': 'Jehovah will enter into judgment<br>With the elders of His people and their rulers.<br>It is you who have consumed the vineyard;<br>The spoil of the poor is in your houses.',
'3:15': 'What do you mean by crushing My people<br>And grinding the faces of the poor?<br>Declares the Lord Jehovah of hosts.',
'3:16': 'Moreover Jehovah said,<br>Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,<br>And walk around with outstretched necks<br>And lusting eyes,<br>And trip along with quick, little steps,<br>And rattle the anklets on their feet;',
'3:17': 'The Lord will strike the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs,<br>And Jehovah will expose their secret parts.',
'3:18': 'In that day the Lord will remove the beauty of their anklets, headbands, and crescents;',
'3:19': 'The ear pendants, the bracelets, and the costly veils;',
'3:20': 'The headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the bottles of aromas, and the amulets;',
'3:21': 'The finger rings and the nose rings;',
'3:22': 'The formal gowns, the frocks, the wraps, and the purses;',
'3:23': 'The mirrors, the fine linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.',
'3:24': 'And instead of a sweet smell there will be rottenness;<br>And instead of a belt, an encircling rope;<br>Instead of well-set hair, baldness;<br>And instead of fine garments, the girding of oneself with sackcloth;<br>A brand instead of beauty.',
'3:25': 'Your men will fall by the sword,<br>And your mighty, in battle;',
'3:26': 'Then her gates will mourn and lament,<br>And she, being desolated, will sit on the ground.',
'4:1': 'And seven [1]women will grasp<br>One man in that day,<br>Saying, We will eat our own bread<br>And wear our own clothes;<br>Just let us bear your name;<br>Take away our [a]reproach.',
'4:2': 'In [1]that day the [2a]Shoot of Jehovah will be beauty and glory, and the [2]fruit of the earth, excellence and splendor, to those of Israel who have escaped.',
'4:3': 'And he who is left over in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, everyone who has been [a]written down in Jerusalem for life;',
'4:4': 'When the Lord has [a]washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and has cleansed away the bloodstains of Jerusalem from her midst, by the [1]judging Spirit and the burning Spirit.',
'4:5': 'Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a [a]cloud of smoke by day, and the brightness of a [b]fiery flame by night; for the glory will be a [1]canopy over all.',
'4:6': 'And there will be a tabernacle as a daytime shade from the heat and as a refuge and a [a]cover from storm and rain.',
'5:1': 'Let me sing of my Beloved,<br>A song of my Beloved concerning His [a]vineyard.<br>My Beloved had a vineyard<br>On a [1]fertile hill.',
'5:2': 'And He dug it up and cleared away its stones,<br>And He planted it with the choicest vine.<br>Then He built a tower in the middle of it,<br>And hewed out a wine vat in it.<br>And He looked for it to produce grapes,<br>But it produced only wild grapes.',
'5:3': 'So then, you inhabitants of Jerusalem<br>And you men of Judah,<br>Judge between Me<br>And My vineyard.',
'5:4': 'What more could I have done for My vineyard<br>That I have not already done for it?<br>Why then, when I looked for it to produce grapes,<br>Did it produce only wild grapes?',
'5:5': 'And now I will make known to you<br>What I will now do to My vineyard:<br>I will remove its [a]hedge, and it will be consumed;<br>I will break down its wall, and it will become a trampled place.',
'5:6': 'And I will make it a waste;<br>It will not be pruned, nor will it be hoed;<br>But thorns and thistles will come on it.<br>And I will command the clouds<br>Not to rain upon it.',
'5:7': 'For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel,<br>And the men of Judah, the plant of His good pleasure;<br>And He expected justice, but instead, bloodshed!<br>He expected righteousness, but instead, an outcry of distress!',
'5:8': 'Woe to those who join house to house,<br>Who lay field to field,<br>Till there is no place left,<br>And you dwell alone in the midst of the land!',
'5:9': 'In my ears Jehovah of hosts has sworn:<br>Many houses shall indeed become desolate;<br>Great ones and fine ones shall be without inhabitants.',
'5:10': 'For ten acres of vineyard will produce a mere [1]bath of wine,<br>And a [2]homer of seed will produce an [3]ephah of grain.',
'5:11': 'Woe to those who rise early in the morning<br>That they may run after liquor,<br>To those who linger into the evening<br>That wine may inflame them!',
'5:12': 'Lyre and harp, tambourine and flute,<br>And wine are the essence of their banquets;<br>And they do not consider what has been done by Jehovah,<br>Nor do they regard the work of His hands.',
'5:13': 'Hence, my people go into [a]exile<br>For lack of knowledge;<br>Their [1]nobility become famished men,<br>And their multitudes, parched with thirst.',
'5:14': 'Hence, Sheol enlarges its appetite<br>And opens its mouth wide, without limit,<br>And Jerusalem&rsquo;s splendor descends, and her din<br>And her uproar and the jubilant within her.',
'5:15': 'Thus the ordinary man is humbled, and the man of distinction is abased;<br>And the eyes of the [a]haughty are abased;',
'5:16': 'But Jehovah of hosts is exalted in judgment,<br>And the holy God [1]shows Himself [2]holy in righteousness.',
'5:17': 'Then lambs will graze there as in their pasture,<br>And strangers will eat the wastelands of [1]fat men.',
'5:18': 'Woe to those who draw iniquity with ropes of vanity,<br>And sin as with cart ropes;',
'5:19': 'Who say, He should hurry up;<br>He should hasten His work,<br>So that we may see it;<br>And the counsel of the Holy One of Israel<br>Should draw near and happen,<br>So that we may know it!',
'5:20': 'Woe to those who [a]call evil good,<br>And good evil;<br>Who put darkness for light,<br>And light for darkness;<br>Who put bitter for sweet,<br>And sweet for bitter!',
'5:21': 'Woe to those who are [a]wise in their own eyes,<br>And prudent in their own sight!',
'5:22': 'Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine,<br>And men of valor in mixing liquor;',
'5:23': 'Who acquit the criminal as a result of a bribe,<br>But refuse righteousness to the righteous!',
'5:24': 'Therefore as a tongue of fire consumes the stubble,<br>And the chaff sinks in flames,<br>Their root will be like decay,<br>And their bud will disappear like dust;<br>For they have rejected the instruction of Jehovah of hosts<br>And despised the speaking of the Holy One of Israel.',
'5:25': 'For this reason the anger of Jehovah burns against His people,<br>And He stretches out His [a]hand over them and strikes them.<br>And the mountains quake, and their corpses are<br>Like garbage in the middle of the street.<br>In spite of all this His anger is not turned away;<br>Rather, His hand is still stretched out.',
'5:26': 'He also lifts up a [a]standard to a distant [1]nation,<br>And [b]whistles to it from the [c]ends of the earth;<br>And indeed it comes with [d]swift speed.',
'5:27': 'None of them is weary, and none stumbles among them;<br>No one slumbers or sleeps;<br>And their belts are not loosened at their waists,<br>Nor are their sandal thongs broken.',
'5:28': 'The arrows of these are sharpened,<br>And all their bows are drawn;<br>The hooves of their horses are considered to be like flint,<br>And their chariot wheels like a whirlwind.',
'5:29': 'Their roar is like a lion&rsquo;s,<br>And they roar like young lions;<br>When they growl and seize prey,<br>They carry it away safe, and there is none to rescue it.',
'5:30': 'And they will growl over it in that day,<br>Like the roaring of the sea.<br>When one will look upon the land, indeed, there will be darkness and distress,<br>And the light will be darkened with its clouds.',
'6:1': 'In the year that King [a]Uzziah died I saw the [1b]Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His [2]robe filled the temple.',
'6:2': 'Seraphim [1]hovered over [2]Him, each having six wings: With [a]two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.',
'6:3': 'And one called to the other, saying:<br>[1a]Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts;<br>The whole [b]earth is filled with His glory.',
'6:4': 'And the [1]foundations of the threshold [2]shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was [a]filled with [2]smoke.',
'6:5': 'Then I said,<br>Woe is me, for I am finished!<br>For I am a man of [1a]unclean lips,<br>And in the midst of a people of [1]unclean lips I dwell;<br>Yet my eyes have [b]seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.',
'6:6': 'Then one of the seraphim flew to me with an [1]ember in his hand, which he had taken from the [a]altar with a pair of tongs.',
'6:7': 'And he touched my [a]mouth with it and said,<br>Now that this has touched your lips,<br>Your iniquity is taken away, and your sin is [1]purged.',
'6:8': 'Then I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall [1]I send? Who will go for [1a]Us? And I said, [b]Here am I; send me.',
'6:9': 'And He said to me, [1]Go and say to this people,<br>[a]Hear indeed, but do not perceive;<br>And see indeed, but do [b]not understand.',
'6:10': '[a]Make the [b]heart of this people numb;<br>Dull their ears,<br>And seal their [c]eyes;<br>Lest they see with their eyes and hear with their [d]ears,<br>And their heart perceive and return, and they are [1e]healed.',
'6:11': 'And I said, For how long, Lord? And He said,<br>Until cities lie devastated,<br>Without inhabitants,<br>And houses are without people,<br>And the land is [a]devastated and a waste;',
'6:12': 'And Jehovah has sent men far away from it,<br>And desolate places abound in the midst of the land.',
'6:13': 'But there will still be a tenth part in it;<br>And it in turn is to be burned<br>Like a terebinth or an oak,<br>Whose stump remains after its felling;<br>Its stump will be a [a]holy seed.',
'7:1': 'In the days of [a]Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, the king of Judah, Rezin the king of Aram and Pekah the son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they were not able to prevail against it.',
'7:2': 'And it was reported to the house of David that Aram allied with [1]Ephraim, and his heart and the heart of his people quivered as the trees of the forest quiver in the face of a wind.',
'7:3': 'Then Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out to meet Ahaz, you and [1]Shear-jashub your son, at the end of the conduit of the [a]upper pool, on the road to the Fuller&rsquo;s Field;',
'7:4': 'And say to him, Be careful and be quiet; do not fear, and do not be fainthearted because of these two smoking firebrand stubs, at the burning anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.',
'7:5': 'Because Aram and Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have planned evil against you, saying,',
'7:6': 'Let us go up against Judah and make it sick with terror and break it open for ourselves, and let us set the son of Tabel in its midst as king;',
'7:7': 'Thus says the Lord Jehovah,<br>It shall not stand, and it shall not happen;',
'7:8': 'For the head of Aram is Damascus,<br>And the head of Damascus is Rezin;<br>[a]And in another sixty-five years<br>Ephraim will be shattered as a people.',
'7:9': 'And the head of Ephraim is Samaria,<br>And the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah;<br>If you do not believe, surely you will not remain standing.',
'7:10': 'Then Jehovah spoke further to Ahaz, saying,',
'7:11': 'Ask for a sign from Jehovah your God; [1]make it as deep as [2]Sheol, or make it as high as high can go.',
'7:12': 'And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and I will not [a]try Jehovah.',
'7:13': 'And he said, Hear now, O house of David, is it too small a thing for you to exhaust the patience of men that you will exhaust the patience of my God as well?',
'7:14': 'Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: [a]Behold, the [b]virgin will conceive and will [c]bear a son, and she will call his name [1d]Immanuel.',
'7:15': 'He will eat [a]curds and honey [1]until he knows how to refuse evil and choose good.',
'7:16': 'For before this boy knows how to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be abandoned.',
'7:17': 'Jehovah will bring upon you and your people and the house of your father such days as have not been [a]since the days when Ephraim turned away from Judah; He will [b]bring upon you the king of Assyria.',
'7:18': 'And in that day Jehovah will [a]whistle for the [1]flies which are at the ends of the rivers of Egypt and for the [1]bees which are in the land of Assyria.',
'7:19': 'And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines and the clefts of the cliffs and on all the thornbushes and on all watering places.',
'7:20': 'In that day the Lord will shave with the [a]razor hired from beyond the [1]River, with the king of Assyria, the [2]head and the [2]hair of the legs; and it will take away the [2]beard as well.',
'7:21': 'And in that day each man will keep alive only a milk cow and two females of the flock.',
'7:22': 'And because of the abundance of milk produced, he will eat curds; for everyone left behind in the midst of the land will eat curds and honey.',
'7:23': 'And in that day every place where there could be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become thorns and thistles.',
'7:24': 'Men will come there with arrows and bow, for all the land will be thorns and thistles.',
'7:25': 'And to all the hills that once were hoed with the hoe you will not go for fear of thorns and thistles; but they will become a place for cattle to roam in and for sheep to trample.',
'8:1': 'Then Jehovah said to me, Take a large tablet and [a]write on it in plain letters, For [1]Maher-shalal-hash-baz;',
'8:2': 'And I will take faithful witnesses, [a]Urijah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.',
'8:3': 'And I went to the prophetess, and she [1]conceived and bore a son. And Jehovah said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz,',
'8:4': 'For [a]before this boy knows how to call, Father, and, Mother, they will carry off the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria.',
'8:5': 'Then Jehovah spoke further to me, saying,',
'8:6': 'Because these people have rejected<br>The gently flowing [1]waters of [a]Shiloah, and exult<br>In Rezin and the son of Remaliah,',
'8:7': 'Now therefore the Lord is bringing up upon them<br>The mighty and abundant [1a]waters of the Euphrates,<br>The king of Assyria and all his glory;<br>And it will overflow all its channels,<br>And go over all its banks.',
'8:8': 'It will sweep through Judah; it will overflow and rise<br>Until it reaches the neck;<br>And the spreading out of its wings<br>Will fill the breadth of Your [1]land, O [a]Immanuel.',
'8:9': 'Be broken, O peoples, and be shattered;<br>Hearken, all you distant places of the earth:<br>Gird yourselves, yet be shattered;<br>Gird yourselves, yet be shattered.',
'8:10': 'Take [a]counsel, yet it will be frustrated;<br>Speak the word, yet it will not stand;<br>For [b]God is with us.',
'8:11': 'For Jehovah spoke to me in this way with great force and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,',
'8:12': 'You shall not call it conspiracy<br>All that this people calls conspiracy;<br>And you shall not [a]fear what they fear nor hold it in awe.',
'8:13': 'You shall [a]sanctify Jehovah of hosts;<br>He shall be the One to fear and He shall be the One to hold in awe.',
'8:14': 'Then He will become a [1a]sanctuary, yet a [1b]stone to strike against<br>And a [1]rock of [c]stumbling<br>To both houses of Israel,<br>A trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.',
'8:15': 'And many will stumble [1]at these,<br>And will fall and be broken to pieces,<br>And will be snared and taken captive.',

'27:8': 'By expulsion and by banishing them, You contended with them;<br>He sent them away with His harsh wind in the day of the east wind.',
'27:9': 'Thus by this the iniquity of Jacob will be expiated,<br>And this is all the fruit of the [a]removal of their sin;<br>When they make all the stones of their altar<br>Like chalk stones beaten to powder&mdash;<br>Asherahs and sun images will not stand.',
'27:10': 'For the fortified city is isolated;<br>The habitation is given up and abandoned like a wilderness.<br>There the calf will feed,<br>And there he will lie down and consume its branches.',
'27:11': 'When its boughs are withered, they will be broken off;<br>Women come and make a fire with them;<br>For they are [a]not a people of understanding.<br>Therefore He who made them will not have compassion on them,<br>And He who formed them will not show favor to them.',
'27:12': 'And in that day Jehovah will beat out the [1]grain from the flowing stream of<br>the [2]River<br>Unto the brook of Egypt;<br>And you will be [a]gleaned<br>One by one, O you children of Israel.',
'27:13': 'And in that day a great [a]trumpet will be blown,<br>And the ones lost in the land of Assyria will come,<br>As well as the outcasts in the land of Egypt,<br>And they will worship Jehovah<br>On the holy mountain in Jerusalem.',
'28:1': 'Woe to the proud crown of the drunkards of [1]Ephraim<br>And to the fading flower of its glorious beauty,<br>Which is at the head of the fat valley of those who are overcome by wine.',
'28:2': 'Indeed the Lord has [1]someone strong and mighty;<br>As a [a]hailstorm and a tempest of destruction,<br>As a storm of mighty overflowing waters,<br>He will cast down to the earth with His hand.',
'28:3': 'The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim<br>Will be trodden under foot;',

'28:14': 'Therefore hear the word of Jehovah,<br>You scoffing men,<br>Who rule this people<br>Who are in [1]Jerusalem:',
'28:15': 'Because you have said, We have made<br>A covenant with [a]death,<br>And with Sheol<br>We have made an agreement:<br>When the overflowing scourge passes through,<br>It will not come upon us;<br>For we have made falsehood our refuge<br>And have hidden ourselves in deception.',
'28:16': 'Therefore thus says<br>The Lord Jehovah:<br>[a]Indeed I lay a [1b]stone in Zion as a foundation,<br>A tested stone,<br>A precious [1]cornerstone as a foundation firmly established;<br>[c]He who believes will not hasten away.',

'28:22': 'Now therefore do not be mockers,<br>Lest your fetters become stronger;<br>For I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts<br>Of complete and decisive [a]destruction upon the whole earth.',

'28:24': 'Does the [1]plowman plow all day long to sow his seed?<br>Does he open and harrow his ground continually?',
'28:25': 'Does he not, once he levels the surface,<br>Scatter dill and broadcast cummin,<br>And put the wheat in rows and the barley in its appointed place<br>And the rye where it belongs?',
'28:26': 'For his God instructs him toward such discretion<br>And teaches him so.',
'28:27': 'For dill is not threshed with a sharp tool,<br>Nor is the cart wheel turned upon the cummin;<br>But dill is beaten out with a rod,<br>And cummin with a stick.',
'28:28': 'Bread grains are ground,<br>Yet one does not thresh and thresh forever.<br>And once the wheel of his cart and his horses drive over it,<br>One does not grind it.',

'29:7': 'And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,<br>Even all who fight against her and her stronghold and who distress her,<br>Will be like a dream, like a vision in the night.',

'29:12': 'Then the book will be given to him who is illiterate, saying, Please read this, and he will say, I am illiterate.',
'29:13': 'And the Lord said,<br>[a]Because this people [1]draws near with their mouth,<br>And with their lips they honor Me,<br>Yet they remove their heart far from Me,<br>And their fear for Me<br>Is a commandment of men merely learned;',

'36:1': '[a]In the fourteenth year of King [1]Hezekiah, Sennacherib the [b]king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them.',
'36:2': '[a]And the king of Assyria sent the Rab-shakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great force. And he stood at the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the Fuller&rsquo;s Field.',
'36:3': '[a]Then [b]Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to him.',
'36:4': 'And the Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, [a]Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What is this confidence in which you trust?',
'36:5': 'I say, It is but a vain word that you say, There is counsel and strength for war. Now in whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?',
'36:6': 'You now have put your trust in the staff of this broken [a]reed, in Egypt, which, if a man should lean on it, will go into his hand and pierce it, for so is Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to all who trust in him.',
'36:7': 'And if you say to me, We trust in Jehovah our God; is it not He whose high places and altars [a]Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship only before [b]this altar?',
'36:8': 'Now therefore give pledges to my master, the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if indeed you are able to set riders on them.',
'36:9': 'How then can you refuse one official of the least of my master&rsquo;s servants and put your trust in [a]Egypt for chariots and horsemen?',
'36:10': 'And have I now come up apart from Jehovah against this land to destroy it? Jehovah said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.',
'36:11': 'And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to the Rab-shakeh, Please speak to your servants in [a]Aramaic, because we understand it; and do not speak to us in the [b]Jews&rsquo; language, in the ears of the people upon the wall.',
'36:12': 'But the Rab-shakeh said, Has my master sent me only to your master and to you to speak these words, and not to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own urine with you?',
'36:13': 'Then the Rab-shakeh stood and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews&rsquo; language, and said, Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria:',
'36:14': 'Thus says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, because he is not able to deliver you;',
'36:15': 'Neither let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.',
'36:16': 'Do not listen to Hezekiah; for thus says the king of Assyria, Make your peace with me, and come out to me, and let each eat from his own [a]vine and each from his own fig tree, and let each drink the waters of his own cistern;',
'36:17': 'Until I come and take you away to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.',
'36:18': '[a]Be careful lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, Jehovah will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?',
'36:19': 'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?',
'36:20': 'Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?',
'36:21': 'But they were silent and did not answer him a word, because of the commandment of the king that said, You shall not answer him.',
'36:22': 'Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him the words of the Rab-shakeh.',
'37:1': '[a]And when King Hezekiah heard, he [1]tore his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of Jehovah.',
'37:2': 'And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, who had covered themselves in sackcloth, to [a]Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet.',
'37:3': 'And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah, This day is a day of affliction, rebuke, and contempt, for children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.',
'37:4': 'It may be that Jehovah your God will hear the words of the Rab-shakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which Jehovah your God has heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the [a]remnant which is left.',
'37:5': 'So the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.',
'37:6': 'And Isaiah said to them, Thus you shall say to your master, Thus says Jehovah, Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed Me.',
'37:7': 'Indeed I will put a spirit in him, so that he will hear a report and return to his land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.',
'37:8': 'And the Rab-shakeh returned and found the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah, because he had heard that the king had departed from Lachish.',
'37:9': 'And he heard a report about Tirhakah the king of Ethiopia which said, He has come forth to make war with you. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,',
'37:10': 'In this way you shall speak to Hezekiah the king of Judah, saying, Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.',
'37:11': 'Indeed you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands, destroying them utterly. And will you be delivered?',
'37:12': 'Have the gods of the nations, whom my fathers destroyed, delivered them: Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the children of Eden, who were in Telassar?',
'37:13': 'Where are the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena and Ivvah?',
'37:14': 'And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it, and Hezekiah went up to the house of Jehovah and spread it before Jehovah.',
'37:15': '[a]And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,',
'37:16': 'O Jehovah of hosts, God of Israel, You who are enthroned between the [a]cherubim, You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth; You [b]made the heavens and the earth.',
'37:17': 'Incline Your ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open Your eyes, O Jehovah, and see; and listen to all the words of Sennacherib, who has sent messengers to reproach the living God.',
'37:18': 'Truly, O Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the countries and their land,',
'37:19': 'And have cast their gods into the fire, because they were [a]not gods, but the work of men&rsquo;s hands, wood and stone; so they destroyed them.',
'37:20': 'And now, O Jehovah our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are Jehovah.',
'37:21': 'Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah, saying, Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel, Because you have prayed to Me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyria,',
'37:22': 'This is the word which Jehovah has spoken concerning him:<br>The virgin [a]daughter of Zion<br>Has despised you and laughed at you;<br>The daughter of Jerusalem<br>Has shaken her head behind you.',
'37:23': 'Whom have you reproached and reviled?<br>Against whom have you lifted up your voice<br>And lifted up your eyes haughtily?<br>Against the Holy One of Israel.',
'37:24': 'By your servants you have reproached the Lord,<br>And you have said, In the multitude of my chariots,<br>I have come up to the heights of the mountains,<br>To the sides of Lebanon.<br>And I will cut down its tall cedars,<br>And the choicest of its cypresses:<br>I will enter into its farthest height<br>And its luxuriant forest.',
'37:25': 'I have dug;<br>I have drunk water;<br>With the sole of my foot I have dried up<br>All the rivers of [1]Egypt.',
'37:26': 'Have you not heard<br>That long ago I did it;<br>And from the days of old I had formed it?<br>Now I have brought it to pass,<br>That you should destroy fortified cities,<br>And make them into ruinous heaps.',
'37:27': 'Therefore their inhabitants were short of strength;<br>They were dismayed and felt ashamed;<br>And they were like vegetation of the field<br>And green shoots of tender grass,<br>Like grass which grows on the housetops<br>And [1]is scorched before it has grown up.',
'37:28': 'But I know your sitting down,<br>And your going out and your coming in,<br>And your raging against Me.',
'37:29': 'Because your raging against Me<br>And your arrogance has come up into My ears,<br>I will put My hook in your nose<br>And My bridle in your lips,<br>And [a]turn you back on the way by which you came.',
'37:30': 'This shall be the sign to you: This year you shall eat that which grows up of itself, and the second year that which shoots up from the same, and in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat their fruit.',
'37:31': 'And the [a]remnant of those who have escaped of the house of Judah will again take [b]root downward and bear fruit upward.',
'37:32': 'For a remnant will go forth out of Jerusalem, and from Mount Zion those who have escaped. The [a]zeal of Jehovah of hosts will perform this.',
'37:33': 'Therefore, thus says Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria,<br>He shall not come to this city,<br>Nor shoot an arrow there;<br>Neither shall he come against it with shields,<br>And build up a mound against it.',
'37:34': 'By the way on which he came,<br>By the same shall he return,<br>And into this city he shall not come,<br>Declares Jehovah.',
'37:35': 'And around this city I will put an [a]enclosure<br>To save it,<br>For My [1]own sake<br>And for the sake of [1]David, My servant.',
'37:36': 'Then the [a]angel of Jehovah went out and struck the Assyrians&rsquo; camp, a hundred and eighty-five thousand; and when they arose early in the morning, all of them were corpses, dead.',
'37:37': 'Then Sennacherib the king of Assyria departed and went back to dwell in Nineveh.',
'37:38': 'And when he was worshipping in the house of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons slew him with the sword; and they escaped to the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.',
'38:1': '[a]In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill; and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, [b]Put your house in order, for you are about to die and will not live.',
'38:2': 'And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Jehovah,',
'38:3': 'And said, Now, O Jehovah, please remember how I have walked before You in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in Your sight. And Hezekiah wept many tears.',
'38:4': 'Then the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying,',
'38:5': 'Go and speak to Hezekiah, Thus says Jehovah, the God of David your father, I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; I will now add to your life [1]fifteen years.',
'38:6': 'And I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will put an [a]enclosure around this city.',
'38:7': '[a]And this will be the [b]sign from Jehovah to you, that Jehovah will do this thing which He has spoken.',
'38:8': 'Behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which has gone down with the sun on the steps of Ahaz, to go back ten steps. So the sun&rsquo;s shadow went back ten steps on the steps on which it had gone down.',
'38:9': 'The writing of Hezekiah the king of Judah when he had been sick and had recovered from his sickness:',
'38:10': 'I said, In the middle of my days,<br>I will go into the [a]gates of Sheol;<br>I have been deprived of the rest of my years.',

'38:13': 'I have stilled myself until the morning;<br>Like a lion, so He breaks all my bones;<br>From day until night You make an end of me.',
'38:14': 'Like a swallow and a crane, so I twitter;<br>Like a dove, I mourn;<br>My eyes look languishingly above;<br>O Lord, I am oppressed; be my surety.',
'38:15': 'What shall I say? He has both spoken to me,<br>And He Himself has done it;<br>I will walk [1]deliberately all my years,<br>Because of the bitterness of my soul.',
'38:16': 'O Lord, upon these things men live;<br>And in all of these things is the life of my spirit;<br>Therefore may You restore my strength<br>And make me live.',
'38:17': 'Indeed for peace I had bitterness, yes, bitterness;<br>But You have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of destruction,<br>Because You have [a]cast behind Your back<br>All my sins.',
'38:18': 'For [1a]Sheol cannot thank You,<br>And Death cannot praise You;<br>They that go down to the pit<br>Cannot hope in Your truth.',

'38:20': 'Jehovah is ready to save me;<br>Therefore we will sing my songs,<br>With stringed instruments,<br>All the days of our life,<br>In the house of Jehovah.',
'38:21': '[a]Then Isaiah said, Let them take a cake of figs and rub it upon the boil, and he will live.',
'38:22': 'Hezekiah had also said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of Jehovah?',
'39:1': '[a]At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, the king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah because he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered.',
'39:2': 'And Hezekiah was glad for them and showed them [1]his treasury, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the fine oil, and his whole armory and everything which was found among his treasures; there was nothing in his house or in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.',
'39:3': 'Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, What did these men say? And from where have they come to you? And Hezekiah said, They have come to me from a distant land, from Babylon.',
'39:4': 'And he said, What have they seen in your house? And Hezekiah said, They have seen everything that is in my house; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not shown them.',
'39:5': 'Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts:',
'39:6': 'The days are now coming when everything that is in your house and that your fathers have laid up as a treasure unto this day will be carried away to [a]Babylon; nothing will be left, says Jehovah.',
'39:7': 'And they will take away some of your sons who will issue from you, whom you will beget, and they will become [a]eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.',
'39:8': 'And Hezekiah said to Isaiah, The word of Jehovah which you have spoken is [a]good. He said moreover, Indeed there will be peace and truth in [1]my days.',

'65:13': 'Therefore thus says the Lord Jehovah,<br>Indeed, My servants shall eat,<br>But you shall [a]hunger;<br>Indeed, My servants shall drink,<br>But you shall thirst;<br>Indeed, My servants shall rejoice,<br>But you shall be put to shame;',
'65:14': 'Indeed, My servants shall give a ringing shout<br>Because of a heart of joy,<br>But you shall cry out<br>Because of a heart of pain,<br>And because of a broken spirit you shall wail.',
'65:15': 'And you will leave your name as a curse to My chosen ones,<br>And the Lord Jehovah will slay you;<br>And He will call His servants by another name,',
'65:16': 'So that he who blesses himself in the earth<br>Will bless himself in the [1]God of [a]faithfulness,<br>And he who swears in the earth<br>Will swear by the God of faithfulness;<br>Because the former troubles are forgotten<br>And because they are hidden from My sight.',
'65:17': 'For I am now creating [1a]new heavens<br>And a new earth,<br>And the [b]former things will not be remembered,<br>Nor will they [c]come up in the heart.',
'65:18': '[1]But rejoice and exult forever,<br>In what I create,<br>For I am now creating Jerusalem as an exultation<br>And her people as a rejoicing.',
'65:19': 'And I will exult in Jerusalem<br>And rejoice in My people;<br>And there will no longer be heard in her<br>The voice of [a]weeping and the voice of crying.',
'65:20': 'There will no longer be in her<br>An infant who reaches the age of only a few days<br>Nor an old man who does not fill up his days;<br>For the lad will die at a hundred years of age,<br>And the sinner, being a hundred years of age, will be cursed.',
'65:21': 'And they will build houses and inhabit them,<br>And they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.',
'65:22': 'They will not build and another inhabit;<br>They will not plant and another eat;<br>For like the days of a [a]tree are the days of My people,<br>And My chosen ones will enjoy the work of their hands to the full;',
'65:23': 'They will not labor in vain,<br>Nor bear children unto turmoil;<br>For they are the seed of those blessed of Jehovah,<br>And their offspring with them.',
'65:24': 'And it will be that before they call, I will answer;<br>Even while they are speaking, I will hear.',
'65:25': '[1]The [a]wolf and the lamb will feed as one,<br>And the lion will eat straw like the ox,<br>And [b]dust will be the serpent&rsquo;s food;<br>They will not harm nor destroy<br>In all My holy mountain, says Jehovah.',
'66:1': 'Thus says Jehovah,<br>[a]Heaven is My throne,<br>And the earth the [b]footstool for My feet.<br>Where then is the [1]house that you will build for Me,<br>And where is the place of My rest?',
'66:2': 'For all these things My hand has made,<br>And so all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah.<br>But to this kind of man will I look, to him who is [a]poor<br>And of a [b]contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.',
'66:3': 'He who kills an ox is like him who slays a man;<br>He who sacrifices a lamb, like him who breaks a dog&rsquo;s neck;<br>He who offers a meal offering is like him who offers the blood of swine;<br>He who burns incense is like him who blesses an idol.<br>As surely as they have chosen their own ways,<br>And their soul delights in their abominations;',
'66:4': 'Just as surely I will choose what will treat them ill,<br>And I will bring upon them what they dread;<br>Because I [a]called, but no one answered;<br>I spoke, but they did not listen;<br>But they did evil in My sight,<br>And chose that in which I did not delight.',
'66:5': 'Hear the word of Jehovah,<br>You who tremble at His word:<br>Your brothers who hate you,<br>Who cast you out because of My name, said,<br>Let Jehovah be glorified<br>So that we may see your joy.<br>But they will be put to shame.',
'66:6': 'A voice of tumult from the city!<br>A voice from the temple!<br>The voice of Jehovah giving full<br>Recompense to His enemies.',
'66:7': 'Before she travailed,<br>She brought forth;<br>Before her pain came,<br>She gave birth to a man.',
'66:8': 'Who has heard of such a thing?<br>Who has seen such things?<br>Can a land be born in one day?<br>Or can a nation be brought forth all at once?<br>For as soon as Zion travailed,<br>She brought forth her children.',
'66:9': 'Shall I bring to the point of birth and not cause to bring forth?<br>Says Jehovah.<br>Or shall I who cause to bring forth shut the womb?<br>Says your God.',
'66:10': 'Be joyful with Jerusalem and exult for her,<br>All you who love her;<br>Rejoice with her in joy,<br>All you who mourn over her,',
'66:11': 'So that you may nurse and be satisfied<br>With her breasts of consolations,<br>So that you may draw out from her and take excellent delight<br>In the abundance of her glory.',
'66:12': 'For thus says Jehovah,<br>I now am extending to her<br>Peace like a [a]river,<br>And the [1]glory of the nations<br>Like an overflowing stream;<br>And you will [b]nurse, you will be [c]carried on the hip,<br>And you will be bounced on the knees.',
'66:13': 'As one whom his mother comforts,<br>So will I comfort you;<br>And you will be comforted in Jerusalem.',
'66:14': 'And you will see this, and your heart will rejoice,<br>And your [a]bones will flourish like new grass;<br>And the hand of Jehovah will be made known to His servants,<br>And He will be indignant toward His enemies.',
'66:15': 'For behold, Jehovah will come with [a]fire,<br>And His chariots will be like a whirlwind,<br>To render His anger with fury<br>And His rebuke with flames of fire.',
'66:16': 'For with fire Jehovah will execute judgment,<br>And with His [a]sword, upon all flesh;<br>And those slain by Jehovah will be many.',
'66:17': 'Those who sanctify and purify themselves for the gardens,<br>Following after one in the midst,<br>Eating swine&rsquo;s flesh<br>And what is abominable and even mice,<br>Will come to an end together, declares Jehovah.',
'66:18': 'But [1]I&mdash;their works and their thoughts I will repay; the time is coming to gather all the nations and tongues; and they will come and see My glory.',
'66:19': 'And I will set a sign among them and will send those who have escaped from them unto the nations: to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, to those who draw the bow; to Tubal and [1]Javan, to the distant coastlands that have not heard My fame nor seen My glory; and they will declare My glory among the nations.',
'66:20': 'And they will [a]bring all your brothers from all the nations as a [1]meal offering to Jehovah, on horses and in chariots and in wagons and on mules and on camels, to My holy mountain, Jerusalem, says Jehovah, just as the children of Israel bring their meal offering in a clean vessel to the house of Jehovah.',
'66:21': 'And I will also take some of them for [a]priests and for Levites, says Jehovah.',
'66:22': 'For as the [1a]new heavens<br>And new earth, which I make,<br>Remain before Me, declares Jehovah,<br>So will your seed and your name remain.',
'66:23': 'And from new moon to new moon<br>And from Sabbath to Sabbath<br>All flesh will [a]come<br>To bow down before Me, says Jehovah.',
'66:24': 'Then they will go forth and look<br>On the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me;<br>For their [a]worm will not die,<br>Nor will their [b]fire be quenched;<br>And they will be an abhorrence to all flesh.',

{sup:"a", word:"vision", vrefs:"Num. 12:6"},
{sup:1, word:"Isaiah", lines:["Meaning the salvation of Jah. The book of Isaiah, in its content concerning God&rsquo;s eternal economy in Christ, is the leading book among all the books of the prophets. This book is the vision that Isaiah saw ({Isa1:1|v. 1}), the word that Isaiah saw ({Isa2:1|2:1}), and the burden that Isaiah saw ({Isa13:1|13:1}; {Isa15:1|15:1}). The vision, word, and burden in Isaiah are concerned with God&rsquo;s eternal economy in Christ, which is thoroughly covered in this book.","The book of Isaiah unveils that God&rsquo;s dealing in love with His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment upon the nations bring in Christ, the Savior ({Isa43:3|43:3}; {Isa49:26|49:26}), who is God ({Isa9:6|9:6}) incarnated to be a man ({Isa7:14|7:14}), possessing both the divine nature and the human nature ({Isa4:2|4:2}), living on this earth ({Isa53:2|53:2}-{Isa53:3|3}; {Isa42:1|42:1}-{Isa42:4|4}), crucified ({Isa53:7|53:7}-{Isa53:10|10a}, {Isa53:12|12}), resurrected ({Isa53:10|53:10b}-{Isa53:11|11}), ascended ({Isa52:13|52:13}), and coming ({Isa40:10|40:10}; {Isa64:1|64:1}) to meet the need of God&rsquo;s chosen people and the nations ({Isa9:1|9:1}-{Isa9:7|7}; {Isa49:6|49:6}) in God&rsquo;s all-inclusive salvation ({Isa12:2|12:2}-{Isa12:3|3}), that the restoration of all things, of the created yet fallen universe ({Isa2:2|2:2}-{Isa2:5|5}; {Isa11:6|11:6}-{Isa11:9|9}; {Isa35:1|35:1}-{Isa35:10|10}; {Isa30:26|30:26}), may be brought in, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth for eternity ({Isa65:17|65:17}). Hence, the content of Isaiah covers God&rsquo;s entire economy of the New Testament, from the incarnation ({Mat1:18|Matt. 1:18}-{Mat1:25|25}) to the new heaven and new earth ({Rev21|Rev. 21}&mdash;{Rev22|22}), with the Old Testament background of God&rsquo;s dealing with Israel and His judgment upon the nations. According to Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, the Christ who was processed for the divine purposes is the centrality and universality of the great wheel of the move of the Divine Trinity ({Ezk1:15|Ezek. 1:15} and {Ezk1:15^1|note 1}) for the accomplishing of His economy in the divine dispensing of Himself into His elect."]},

As indicated in {Luk4:16|Luke 4:16}-{Luk4:22|22a} (see {Luk4:18^1|notes} there), vv. {Isa61:1|1}-{Isa61:2|2a} in this chapter refer to Christ in His first coming, in which His ministry was to announce the gospel of grace. Verses {Isa61:2|2b}-{Isa61:3|3} refer to Christ in His second coming, in which His ministry will be to avenge Israel that they may be restored. The prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah was fulfilled as a foretaste at Christ&rsquo;s first coming, for the age of grace as the acceptable year of Jehovah, the New Testament jubilee (see {Lev25:10^1P2|note 10<sup>1</sup>, par. 2}, in {Lev25|Lev. 25}), resulting in the producing and building up of the church. This prophecy will be fulfilled as a full taste at Christ&rsquo;s second coming, for the restoration of Israel unto the new heavens and new earth ({Isa65:17|65:17}; {Isa66:22|66:22}).","Christ&rsquo;s coming is of two parts and at two times. In His first coming, Christ came to minister, to dispense, Himself into His followers. In this way He carried out the New Testament ministry to dispense the Triune God into the disciples under His ministry, most of whom were Jews. This ministry in Christ&rsquo;s first coming laid a solid foundation for His second coming. When He comes the second time, He will come mainly in an outward way to rescue Israel from their circumstances and to bring in their restoration ({Zec12|Zech. 12}&mdash;{Zec14|14}). This restoration will be expanded to include all things created by God ({Isa2:2|2:2}-{Isa2:5|5}; {Isa11:6|11:6}-{Isa11:9|9}; {Isa30:26|30:26}; {Isa35:1|35:1}-{Isa35:10|10}; {Isa65:25|65:25}). It will last for a millennium, for the thousand-year kingdom ({Rev20:2|Rev. 20:2}-{Rev20:7|7}).","In the eyes of God, Christ&rsquo;s two comings are two aspects of one unique coming of Christ from God to mankind. Hence, in Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy these two comings are like two mountain peaks which, when viewed from a distance, seem to be one peak. For this reason Isaiah viewed Christ&rsquo;s first coming and second coming as being together."]},

In the Old Testament both the tabernacle and the temple were only symbols of God&rsquo;s union with the children of Israel, whom God considered His actual house ({Heb3:6|Heb. 3:6} and {Heb3:6^1|note}). God was united with the children of Israel and became one entity with them, and this one entity was a spiritual house in which both God and the godly people in Israel dwelt ({Psa27:4|Psa. 27:4}; {Psa84:10|84:10}; {Psa90:1|90:1}; cf. {1Pe2:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5a}). According to {Isa66:2|v. 2} and {Isa57:15|57:15}, the dwelling place God desires to have is a group of people into whom He can enter. God intends to have a dwelling place in the universe that is the mingling of God and man, in which God is built into man and man is built into God, so that God and man, man and God, can be a mutual abode to each other ({Joh14:2|John 14:2}, {Joh14:20|20}, {Joh14:23|23}; {Joh15:4|15:4}; {1Jo4:13|1&nbsp;John 4:13}).
