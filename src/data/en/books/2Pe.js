'1:19': '[1]And we have the [a]prophetic word <I>made</I> more [b]firm, to which you do well to give heed as to a [2c]lamp shining in a [3]dark place, until the [4d]day dawns and the [e]morning star rises in your hearts;',
'1:20': 'Knowing this first, that no prophecy of [a]Scripture is of [1]one&rsquo;s own [2]interpretation;',

'2:11': 'Whereas [1]angels, though they are greater in strength and power, [2]do not bring a reviling judgment against [1]them before the Lord.',
'2:12': 'But [a]these, like [1]animals [2]without reason, born natural [3]for capture and [4]destruction, reviling in things of which they are ignorant, will also in their corrupting <I>of</I> <I>others</I> be [5]destroyed;',
'2:13': '[1]Suffering unrighteousness as the [2a]wages of unrighteousness; considering luxury in the day <I>to</I> <I>be</I> [b]pleasure; [3c]spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits while [d]feasting together with you;',
'2:14': 'Having eyes full of [1a]adultery and not [b]ceasing from sin; [c]enticing [d]unstable souls, having a heart exercised for [e]covetousness, [f]children of [g]curse.',
'2:15': 'Forsaking the [1]straight way, they have [a]gone astray, [2]following the way of [3b]Balaam, the <I>son</I> of Beor, who loved the [c]wages of unrighteousness',
'2:16': 'But had reproof for his own transgression: a dumb [1a]beast of burden, uttering with a man&rsquo;s voice, restrained the madness of the prophet.',
'2:17': 'These are [1]springs [a]without water and mists driven by a storm, for whom the [2b]gloom of darkness is kept.',
'2:18': 'For uttering great [a]swelling <I>words</I> of [b]vanity, they [c]entice by [d]lusts of the flesh, with licentiousness, those who are barely [e]escaping from them who [1]live in error;',
'2:19': 'Promising [a]freedom to them, while they themselves are [b]slaves of [1]corruption; for by whom anyone has been defeated, [2]by this one he has been enslaved.',
'2:20': 'For if, having [a]escaped the [b]defilements of the [c]world by the [d]knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ but having again been [e]entangled in these, they are defeated, the last state has become [f]worse for them than the first.',
'2:21': 'For it would be better for them not to have known the [1]way of righteousness than, knowing <I>it</I>, to [a]turn back from the [b]holy commandment delivered to them.',
'2:22': 'It has happened to them according to the true proverb: The [1a]dog has turned [2]to its own vomit, and the washed sow to wallowing in the mud.',
'3:1': 'This second letter, beloved, I now write to you; in them <I>both</I> I [a]stir up your sincere mind with a [b]reminder,',
'3:2': 'So that you would [a]remember the [1b]words spoken before by the holy [c]prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior <I>preached</I> by your [d]apostles;',
'3:3': 'Knowing this first, that in the [1a]last of days [2b]mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own [c]lusts',
'3:4': 'And saying, [a]Where is the [1b]promise of His [2c]coming? For since the [d]fathers fell [e]asleep, all things continue in this way from the [f]beginning of [g]creation.',
'3:5': 'For [1]this escapes them by their own choosing, that by the [2a]word of God the [3b]heavens [c]were of old and the [3]earth was [4]compacted out of water and through [d]water,',
'3:6': 'Through [1]which the [2a]world [3]then, being [4b]flooded with water, [5c]perished.',
'3:7': 'But the [a]heavens and the earth [1]now, by the [2]same [b]word, have been [c]stored up for [3d]fire, being [e]kept unto the [f]day of [4]judgment and [5g]destruction of [6h]ungodly men.',
'3:8': 'But do not let this one thing [1]escape you, beloved, that with the Lord [2]one day is like a thousand years and a [a]thousand years like one day.',
'3:9': 'The Lord [1]does not [a]delay regarding the [b]promise, as [2]some count [3c]delay, but is [4d]long-suffering toward you, not intending that any [5e]perish but that [6f]all advance to [7g]repentance.',
'3:10': 'But the [1a]day of the Lord will [2]come as a [b]thief, in [3]which the [4c]heavens will pass away with a [5]roar, and the [6]elements, burning with intense heat, will be [7d]dissolved, and the [e]earth and the [8]works in it will be [7]burned up.',
'3:11': 'Since [1]all these things [2]are to be thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be [3]in [a]holy manner of life and [b]godliness,',
'3:12': '[1a]Expecting and hastening the [2]coming of the [3]day of God, on account of [4]which the heavens, being on [b]fire, will be dissolved, and the elements, burning with intense heat, are to be melted away?',
'3:13': 'But according to His [1a]promise we are expecting [2b]new heavens and a new earth, in which [3]righteousness [4]dwells.',
'3:14': 'Therefore, [a]beloved, since you expect these things, be diligent to be [1b]found by Him in [c]peace [2]without spot and [d]without blemish;',
'3:15': 'And [1]count the [2a]long-suffering of our Lord <I>to</I> <I>be</I> [3b]salvation, even as [4]also our beloved brother [c]Paul, according to the [d]wisdom given to him, wrote to you,',
'3:16': 'As also in [1]all <I>his</I> letters, speaking in them concerning [2]these things, in which some things are [a]hard to understand, which the unlearned and [b]unstable [3]twist, as also the [2]rest of the [c]Scriptures, to their own [4]destruction.',
'3:17': 'You therefore, beloved, since you know <I>these</I> <I>things</I> beforehand, [1]be on your guard lest being [2]carried away by the error of the [3]lawless, you [4a]fall from your own [b]steadfastness.',
'3:18': 'But [1a]grow in the [2]grace and [3b]knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. [4]To Him be the [c]glory both now and unto the day of eternity. Amen.',

The equally precious faith, allotted to us by God through the word of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the Spirit, responds to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, making its substance the very element of our Christian life and experience. Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it. As such a portion from God, this faith is objective to us in the divine truth. But it brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all, with itself (faith), subjective to us in our experience.

Hence, apostasy was the background of this book. The burden of the writer was to inoculate the believers against the poison of apostasy. God&rsquo;s salvation is to impart Himself in His Trinity into the believers that He may be their life and life supply. This is God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s plan. The apostasy distracted the believers from the economy of God by leading them into the human logic of puzzling philosophies. This did not lead them to partake of the tree of life, which gives life, but to participate in the tree of knowledge, which brings in death ({Gen2:9|Gen. 2:9}, {Gen2:16|16}-{Gen2:17|17}). Thus the serpent deceived and seduced Eve ({Gen3:1|Gen. 3:1}-{Gen3:6|6}). In order to inoculate against this death-poison, in his healing Epistle the apostle first prescribed the divine power as the strongest and most effective antidote. This provides the believers with all things related to the generating and supplying divine life (not the killing knowledge) and the God-expressing godliness (not the show of human wisdom). This rich divine provision, which is covered in detail in the succeeding verses (to {2Pe1:11|v. 11}), is more than sufficient to enable the believers to live a proper Christian life and overcome the satanic apostasy.","Divine denotes the eternal, unlimited, and almighty divinity of God.

The thought is not extinction but ruin, loss (not of being but of well-being). In {Mat10:28|Matt. 10:28}; {Mat22:7|22:7}; {Mrk12:9|Mark 12:9}; {Luk17:27|Luke 17:27}, {Luk17:29|29}; {Joh3:16|John 3:16}; {Joh10:28|10:28}; {Joh17:12|17:12}; {1Co10:9|1&nbsp;Cor. 10:9}-{1Co10:10|10}; {2Co2:15|2&nbsp;Cor. 2:15}; {2Co4:3|4:3}; {2Th2:10|2&nbsp;Thes. 2:10}; and {Jud5|Jude 5}, {Jud11|11}, this word unveils more concerning God&rsquo;s governmental judgment. In {2Pe3:9|3:9} it denotes the punishment of God&rsquo;s governmental discipline.","(2) Apoleia, akin to apollumi, indicates loss (of well-being, not of being), ruin, destruction, or (physical, spiritual, or eternal) perdition. It is rendered destructive and destruction in {2Pe2:1|2:1}, and destruction in {2Pe2:3|2:3}; {2Pe3:7|3:7}, {2Pe3:16|16}. The same word is used to denote the different results of God&rsquo;s varied judgments (see {1Pe1:17^2P2|note 17<sup>2</sup>, par. 2}, in {1Pe1|1&nbsp;Pet. 1}). In cases such as those described in {2Pe2:1|2:1}, {2Pe2:3|3}; {2Pe3:7|3:7}; {Joh17:12|John 17:12}; {Rom9:22|Rom. 9:22}; {Phi1:28|Phil. 1:28}; {Phi3:19|3:19}; {2Th2:3|2&nbsp;Thes. 2:3}; and {Rev17:8|Rev. 17:8}, {Rev17:11|11}, it denotes eternal perdition. In cases such as those described in {2Pe3:16|3:16} (see {2Pe2:1^4|note 4}) and {Heb10:39|Heb. 10:39} (see {2Pe2:1^2|note 2}), it denotes the punishment of God&rsquo;s governmental discipline, not eternal perdition. In {Mat7:13|Matt. 7:13} and {1Ti6:9|1&nbsp;Tim. 6:9} it denotes a principle used for any case.","(3) Phthora, denoting corruption unto destruction, the destruction that comes with corruption, a destroying by means of corrupting (in reference to morality, soul, and body). It is rendered corruption in {2Pe1:4|1:4} and {2Pe2:19|2:19}, and destruction and corrupting in {2Pe2:12|2:12}; its verb form is used in the future passive voice and is rendered will be destroyed in {2Pe2:12|2:12}, and in the present passive voice, rendered are being corrupted, in {Jud10|Jude 10}. Its significance can be further seen in {Rom8:21|Rom. 8:21}; {1Co3:17|1&nbsp;Cor. 3:17} and notes {1Co3:17^1|1} and {1Co3:17^2|2}; {1Co15:33|15:33}; {2Co7:2|2&nbsp;Cor. 7:2}; {2Co11:3|11:3}; {Gal6:8|Gal. 6:8}; {Rev11:18|Rev. 11:18}; and {Rev19:2|19:2}."]},

Then, all the supernatural calamities of the sixth seal and the first four trumpets will be meted out to smite the earth with the things on it and the heavens with their heavenly bodies ({Rev6:12|Rev. 6:12}-{Rev6:17|17}; {Rev8:7|8:7}-{Rev8:12|12}). This will be the beginning of the great tribulation. The great tribulation, which will consist mainly of the woes of the last three trumpets, including the plagues of the seven bowls, will last for three and a half years ({Mat24:21|Matt. 24:21}-{Mat24:22|22}, {Mat24:29|29}; {Rev8:13|Rev. 8:13}&mdash;{Rev9:21|9:21}; {Rev11:14|11:14}; {Rev15:5|15:5}&mdash;{Rev16:21|16:21}).

At the end of the great tribulation, Christ&rsquo;s parousia (presence), with the overcomers, will come to the air ({Rev10:1|Rev. 10:1}), and the dead saints will be resurrected and raptured together with the majority of the living believers, who will have passed through the great tribulation, to meet with the Lord in the air ({1Co15:52|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:52}; {1Th4:16|1&nbsp;Thes. 4:16}-{1Th4:17|17}; {Rev14:14|Rev. 14:14}-{Rev14:16|16}). After this, all the believers will be judged by the Lord at His judgment seat in the air ({2Co5:10|2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10}). Then the Lord will have His wedding feast with the overcoming saints ({Rev19:7|Rev. 19:7}-{Rev19:8|8}). Immediately after this, the Lord with His bride, composed of the overcoming saints as His army, will come to the earth ({Zec14:4|Zech. 14:4}-{Zec14:5|5}; {Jud14|Jude 14}; {1Th3:13|1&nbsp;Thes. 3:13}) to fight and defeat Antichrist and his army; they will seize Antichrist and his false prophet and cast them alive into the lake of fire ({Rev19:11|Rev. 19:11}-{Rev19:21|21}). At approximately that time, Babylon the Great will be destroyed ({Rev17:1|Rev. 17:1}&mdash;{Rev19:3|19:3}). At the same time, the Lord will deliver, gather, and restore the children of Israel ({Zec12:2|Zech. 12:2}-{Zec12:14|14}; {Rom11:26|Rom. 11:26}; {Mat24:31|Matt. 24:31}; {Act1:6|Acts 1:6}).

Then the Lord will judge the nations (the living&mdash;{Mat25:31|Matt. 25:31}-{Mat25:46|46}; {Joe3:2|Joel 3:2}). After this, the millennial kingdom will come ({Rev20:4|Rev. 20:4}-{Rev20:6|6}). After the thousand years, Satan will be loosed from the abyss and will instigate certain of the nations, Gog and Magog in the north of the eastern hemisphere, to carry out the last rebellion against God. They will be subdued and burned, and the deceiving devil will be cast into the lake of fire ({Rev20:7|Rev. 20:7}-{Rev20:10|10}). Following this, the heavens and the earth will be fully cleared up by being burned up (vv. {2Pe3:7|7}, {2Pe3:10|10}). Then will come the final judgment upon men (the dead) and the demons, and probably also upon the fallen angels ({2Pe2:4|2:4} and {2Pe2:4^4|note 4}), at the great white throne ({Rev20:11|Rev. 20:11}-{Rev20:15|15}). That will be God&rsquo;s consummate dealing with His old creation in His universal government and will be in addition to so many judgments and dealings executed within the day of the Lord to clear up the old universe. Then a new universe will begin with the new heaven and new earth for eternity ({Rev21:1|Rev. 21:1}), in which there will be no more judgment related to God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, for no unighteousness will dwell there. Therefore, not counting the one thousand years, the day of the Lord will be very short, probably not more than seven years. This will be the main part of the last week (seven years) of the seventy weeks in {Dan9:24|Dan. 9:24}-{Dan9:27|27}. It is unscriptural to consider the day of God and the day of the Lord two different days: the day of the Lord ends with the millennial kingdom, and the day of God begins with the burning of the heavens and the earth, followed by the judgment of the great white throne. Actually, since the judgment of the great white throne will be executed by the Lord Jesus ({Act10:42|Acts 10:42}; {Act17:31|17:31}; {2Ti4:1|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:1}), it too will be in the day of the Lord.

He unveiled the crucial things related to God&rsquo;s economy, concerning which things the prophets prophesied and the apostles preached ({1Pe1:10|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:10}-{1Pe1:12|12}), from four sides:","(1) From the side of the Triune God:","God the Father chose a people in eternity according to His foreknowledge ({1Pe1:1|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:1}-{1Pe1:2|2}; {1Pe2:9|2:9}) and called them into His glory ({1Pe5:10|1&nbsp;Pet. 5:10}; {2Pe1:3|2&nbsp;Pet. 1:3}).

The Spirit, sent from heaven, has sanctified and purified those whom Christ has redeemed ({1Pe1:2|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:2}, {1Pe1:12|12}, {1Pe1:22|22}; {1Pe4:14|4:14}). (The angels long to look into these things&mdash;{1Pe1:12|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:12}.) The Triune God&rsquo;s divine power has provided the redeemed ones with all things that relate to life and godliness ({2Pe1:3|1:3}-{2Pe1:4|4}) to guard them unto full salvation ({1Pe1:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:5}). God also disciplines them ({1Pe5:6|1&nbsp;Pet. 5:6}) by some of His varied governmental judgments ({1Pe1:17|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:17}; {1Pe2:23|2:23}; {1Pe4:5|4:5}-{1Pe4:6|6}, {1Pe4:17|17}; {2Pe2:3|2&nbsp;Pet. 2:3}-{2Pe2:4|4}, {2Pe2:9|9}; {2Pe3:7|3:7}), and He will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground them by His all grace ({1Pe5:10|1&nbsp;Pet. 5:10}). The Lord is long-suffering toward them that they all may have opportunity to repent unto salvation (vv. {2Pe3:9|9}, {2Pe3:15|15}). Then, Christ will appear in glory with His full salvation for His lovers ({1Pe1:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:5}, {1Pe1:7|7}-{1Pe1:9|9}, {1Pe1:13|13}; {1Pe4:13|4:13}; {1Pe5:4|5:4}).","(2) From the side of the believers:","The believers, as God&rsquo;s possession, were chosen by God ({1Pe1:1|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:1}-{1Pe1:2|2}; {1Pe2:9|2:9}), called by His glory and virtue ({1Pe2:9|1&nbsp;Pet. 2:9}; {1Pe3:9|3:9}; {2Pe1:3|2&nbsp;Pet. 1:3}, {2Pe1:10|10}), redeemed by Christ ({1Pe1:18|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:18}-{1Pe1:19|19}), regenerated by God through His living word ({1Pe1:3|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3}, {1Pe1:23|23}), and saved through the resurrection of Christ ({1Pe3:21|1&nbsp;Pet. 3:21}).

They are God&rsquo;s chosen race, royal priesthood, holy nation, and peculiar people for His private possession to express His virtues ({1Pe2:9|1&nbsp;Pet. 2:9}).

Further, they are expecting the new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells, in eternity ({2Pe3:13|v. 13}), and they are growing continually in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ ({2Pe3:18|v. 18}).","(3) From the side of Satan:","Satan is the believers&rsquo; adversary, the devil, who as a roaring lion is walking about, seeking someone to devour ({1Pe5:8|1&nbsp;Pet. 5:8}).","(4) From the side of the universe:","The fallen angels were condemned and are awaiting eternal judgment ({2Pe2:4|2:4}); the ancient ungodly world was destroyed by a flood ({2Pe2:5|2:5}; {2Pe3:6|3:6}); the ungodly cities were reduced to ashes ({2Pe2:6|2:6}); the false teachers and heretical mockers in the apostasy and mankind in his evil living will all be judged unto destruction ({2Pe2:1|2:1}, {2Pe2:3|3}, {2Pe2:9|9}-{2Pe2:10|10}, {2Pe2:12|12}; {2Pe3:3|3:3}-{2Pe3:4|4}, {2Pe3:7|7}; {1Pe4:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 4:5}); the heavens and the earth will be burned up (vv. {2Pe3:7|7}, {2Pe3:10|10}-{2Pe3:11|11}); and all the dead men and the demons will be judged ({1Pe4:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 4:5}). Then the new heavens and new earth will come as a new universe, in which God&rsquo;s righteousness will dwell for eternity ({2Pe3:13|v. 13}).","Paul in his writings also spoke concerning &ldquo;these things&rdquo; (except for the new heavens and new earth). Hence, Peter referred to Paul&rsquo;s writings to strengthen his own writings, especially concerning God&rsquo;s governmental and disciplinary judgment upon the believers. Paul strongly and repeatedly emphasized this matter in his writings ({1Co11:30|1&nbsp;Cor. 11:30}-{1Co11:32|32}; {Heb12:5|Heb. 12:5}-{Heb12:11|11}; {Heb2:3|2:3}; {Heb4:1|4:1}; {Heb6:8|6:8}; {Heb10:27|10:27}-{Heb10:31|31}, {Heb10:39|39}; {Heb12:29|12:29}; {1Co3:13|1&nbsp;Cor. 3:13}-{1Co3:15|15}; {1Co4:4|4:4}-{1Co4:5|5}; {2Co5:10|2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10}; {Rom14:10|Rom. 14:10}). This must be the reason Peter highly commended Paul&rsquo;s writings.","What beauty and excellency are in this commendation! Although the Corinthians attempted to divide Peter and Paul according to their divisive preferences ({1Co1:11|1&nbsp;Cor. 1:11}-{1Co1:12|12}), Peter commended Paul, saying that Paul, like him, taught &ldquo;these things&rdquo; and that Paul&rsquo;s writings should not be twisted but should be regarded like &ldquo;the rest of the Scriptures&rdquo; and should receive the same respect as the Old Testament. For Peter to make such a commendation was not a small thing, for it was he who was rebuked to his face by Paul regarding the New Testament faith ({Gal2:11|Gal. 2:11}-{Gal2:21|21}). This indicates that Peter was bold in admitting that the early apostles, such as John, Paul, and himself, although their style, terminology, utterance, certain aspects of their views, and the way they presented their teachings differed, participated in the same, unique ministry, the ministry of the New Testament ({2Co3:8|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:8}-{2Co3:9|9}; {2Co4:1|4:1}). Such a ministry ministers to people, as its focus, the all-inclusive Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, who, after passing through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, dispenses Himself through the redemption of Christ and by the operation of the Holy Spirit into His redeemed people as their unique portion of life and as their life supply and everything, for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the full expression, the fullness, of the Triune God, according to the eternal purpose of the Father."]},
