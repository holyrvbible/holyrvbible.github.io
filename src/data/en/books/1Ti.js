'1:1': '[1]Paul, an [a]apostle of Christ Jesus [b]according to the [2c]command of [3d]God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our [4e]hope,',
'1:2': 'To [1a]Timothy, genuine [b]child in [2]faith: Grace, [c]mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.',
'1:3': 'Even as I exhorted you, when I was [1]going into [a]Macedonia, to remain in [b]Ephesus in order that you might charge [2]certain ones not to teach [3c]different things',
'1:4': 'Nor to give heed to [1a]myths and unending [2b]genealogies, which produce [c]questionings rather than God&rsquo;s [3d]economy, which is in [4e]faith.',
'1:5': 'But the end of the [1]charge is [2a]love out of a [3b]pure heart and <I>out</I> <I>of</I> a good [c]conscience and <I>out</I> <I>of</I> unfeigned [d]faith;',
'1:6': 'From which things some, having [1a]misaimed, have turned aside to [2b]vain talking,',
'1:7': 'Desiring to be [1a]teachers of the law, though they understand neither the things that they say, nor concerning what they [2b]confidently affirm.',
'1:8': 'But we know that the [a]law is good, if one uses it lawfully',
'1:9': '<I>And</I> knows this, that the [a]law is not enacted for a righteous man but for the lawless and [b]unruly, for the [c]ungodly and sinners, for the [d]unholy and [e]profane, for those who [1]strike their fathers and those who [1]strike their mothers, for murderers,',
'1:10': 'For fornicators, [a]homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and whatever other thing that is opposed to the [1b]healthy teaching,',
'1:11': '[a]According to the [1b]gospel of the glory of the [c]blessed God, with which I was [d]entrusted.',
'1:12': 'I give thanks to Him who [1a]empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that He has counted me [b]faithful, [c]appointing <I>me</I> to the [d]ministry,',
'1:13': 'Who formerly was a [1]blasphemer and a [a]persecutor and an [2]insulting person; but I was shown [3b]mercy because, being [4c]ignorant, I acted in [4d]unbelief.',
'1:14': 'And the [1a]grace of our Lord [b]superabounded with [2c]faith and love in Christ Jesus.',
'1:15': '[a]Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus [1]came into the world to save [b]sinners, of whom I am foremost.',
'1:16': 'But because of this I was shown [a]mercy, that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display all His long-suffering for a [1]pattern to those who are to [b]believe on Him unto [2c]eternal life.',

'1:18': 'This [1a]charge I commit to you, <I>my</I> [b]child Timothy, according to the [2c]prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you might [3d]war the good warfare,',
'1:19': '[a]Holding [1b]faith and a good [c]conscience, <I>concerning</I> which some, thrusting <I>these</I> away, have become [2]shipwrecked regarding the [3d]faith;',
'1:20': 'Of whom are [1a]Hymenaeus and [2b]Alexander, whom I have [c]delivered to Satan that they may be [3]disciplined not to [d]blaspheme.',
'2:1': 'I exhort therefore, first of all, that [1a]petitions, prayers, [2]intercessions, thanksgivings be made on behalf of [b]all men;',
'2:2': 'On behalf of [a]kings and all who are in high position, that we may lead a [1]quiet and tranquil life in all [2b]godliness and [3c]gravity.',
'2:3': 'This is good and [a]acceptable in the sight of our [b]Savior God,',
'2:4': 'Who desires [1a]all men to be [b]saved and to come to the [2c]full knowledge of the [d]truth.',
'2:5': 'For there is [1a]one God and one [2b]Mediator of God and men, the [3c]man Christ Jesus,',

'2:11': 'Let a woman learn in [1a]quietness in all [2b]subjection;',
'2:12': 'But I do not permit a [a]woman to [1]teach or to assert authority over a man, but to be in [2]quietness.',

'3:2': '[a]The [1b]overseer then must be [2]without reproach, the [3]husband of [c]one wife, [4d]temperate, [5]of a [e]sober mind, [6]orderly, [7f]hospitable, [8]apt to [g]teach;',
'3:3': '[1]Not an [a]excessive drinker; [2]not a striker, but [3b]gentle; [4c]not contentious; [5]not [d]fond of money;',
'3:4': 'One who [1a]manages well his own house, having <I>his</I> children in subjection with all [2b]gravity',

'3:12': 'Deacons must be [1]husbands of [a]one wife, [2b]managing <I>their</I> children and their own houses well.',
'3:13': 'For those who have [1]ministered well obtain for themselves a [2]good standing and [3]much boldness in [a]faith, which is in Christ Jesus.',

'4:1': '[1]But the [2a]Spirit says expressly that in [3]later times some will [b]depart from the [4c]faith, giving heed to [5]deceiving [d]spirits and teachings of [6e]demons',
'4:2': '[1]By means of the [a]hypocrisy of men who speak [b]lies, of men who are [2c]branded in their own conscience as with a [3]hot iron,',
'4:3': 'Who forbid [1a]marriage <I>and</I> <I>command</I> [b]abstaining from [1c]foods, which [2]God has created to be partaken of with [d]thanksgiving by those who [3e]believe and have [4f]full knowledge of the truth.',
'4:4': 'For [1]every creature of God is [a]good, and nothing is to be rejected if received with thanksgiving;',

'4:6': 'If you lay these things before the brothers, you will be a good [1a]minister of Christ Jesus, [2]being nourished with the words of the [3b]faith and of the [4]good teaching which you [5]have [c]closely followed.',
'4:7': 'But the [1a]profane and old-womanish [2b]myths [3]refuse, and [4]exercise yourself unto [c]godliness.',

'4:9': '[a]Faithful is the word and worthy of all acceptance.',
'4:10': 'For to this end we [a]labor and strive, because we have set our [b]hope on the [1c]living God, who is the [d]Savior of [e]all men, [f]especially of those who believe.',

'5:1': 'Do not [1]upbraid an [a]elderly man, but exhort <I>him</I> as a father, [b]younger men as brothers,',

'5:5': 'Now she who is really a widow and is left alone has set her [a]hope on God and continues in petitions and [b]prayers night and day.',
'5:6': 'But she who gives herself to [a]pleasure is [b]dead while living.',
'5:7': 'These things also [a]charge, that they may be without reproach.',
'5:8': 'But if anyone does not provide for [1]his own, and especially for those of <I>his</I> household, he has [a]denied the [2]faith and is worse than an unbeliever.',

'5:11': 'But younger widows refuse; for when they follow their passions in disregard of Christ, they desire to marry,',
'5:12': '<I>And</I> <I>thus</I> have condemnation because they have set aside their first [1]pledge.',
'5:13': 'And at the same time they also learn to be idle, going around from house to house; and <I>they</I> <I>are</I> not only idle but also gossips and [a]busybodies, speaking [b]things which they ought not.',
'5:14': 'I will therefore that [1]younger <I>widows</I> [a]marry, [2]bear children, [b]keep house, give no opportunity to the opposer for reproach;',
'5:15': 'For already some have turned aside after [a]Satan.',
'5:16': 'If any believing woman has widows <I>in</I> <I>her</I> <I>family</I>, let her assist them, and let not the church be burdened, that it may assist those who are really [a]widows.',
'5:17': 'Let the [a]elders who [b]take the lead well be counted worthy of double [1]honor, [2]especially those who labor in [3]word and teaching.',
'5:18': 'For the Scripture says, [a]&ldquo;You shall not muzzle an ox that is treading out <I>the</I> <I>grain</I>,&rdquo; and, [b]&ldquo;The workman is worthy of his pay.&rdquo;',
'5:19': 'Against an elder do not [1]receive an accusation, except based upon two or three [a]witnesses.',

'5:21': 'I solemnly [a]charge <I>you</I> before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen [1]angels that you keep these things without [2]prejudice, doing nothing by way of [3]partiality.',
'5:22': '[1a]Lay hands [2]quickly on no man, nor [b]participate in others&rsquo; sins; [c]keep yourself pure.',
'5:23': '[1]No longer drink water <I>only</I>, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent [2]illnesses.',
'5:24': 'The [1]sins of some men are openly [2]manifest, going before to judgment; and for others, [3]they [4]also follow after.',
'5:25': 'Likewise also the [1]good works are openly manifest, and those that are otherwise cannot be [a]hidden.',
'6:1': 'As many as are [a]slaves under the yoke should regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, lest the [b]name of God and [1]our [c]teaching be [2]blasphemed.',
'6:2': 'And those who have believing masters should not despise <I>them</I>, because they are [a]brothers; but rather they should [1]serve <I>them</I>, because those who recompense <I>them</I> for the kindly service <I>received</I> are believers and beloved. These things [b]teach and [c]exhort.',
'6:3': 'If anyone teaches [1a]different things and does not consent to [2b]healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which is according to [3c]godliness,',
'6:4': 'He is [1a]blinded with pride, understanding [b]nothing, but is [2]diseased with [c]questionings and [d]contentions of words, out of which come [e]envy, [f]strife, [3]slanders, evil suspicions,',

'6:11': 'But you, O [1a]man of God, [b]flee these things, and [c]pursue [2d]righteousness, [3e]godliness, [4f]faith, [5]love, [6]endurance, [7]meekness.',

{sup:1, word:"Paul", lines:["First Timothy unveils to us God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church, 2&nbsp;Timothy inoculates us against the decline of the church, and Titus is concerned with maintaining the order of the church. These are three aspects of one purpose, that is, to preserve the church as the proper expression of the Triune God, as symbolized by the golden lampstands in the ultimate portion of the divine revelation ({Rev1:12|Rev. 1:12}, {Rev1:20|20}). For the accomplishing of this purpose, the following basic and crucial matters are stressed repeatedly in these three books:","(1) The faith, the contents of the complete gospel according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. It is objective and is mentioned in {1Ti1:4|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:4}, {1Ti1:19|19}; {1Ti2:7|2:7}; {1Ti3:9|3:9}, {1Ti3:13|13}; {1Ti4:1|4:1}, {1Ti4:6|6}; {1Ti5:8|5:8}; {1Ti6:10|6:10}, {1Ti6:12|12}, {1Ti6:21|21}; {2Ti3:8|2&nbsp;Tim. 3:8}; {2Ti4:7|4:7}; and {Tit1:1|Titus 1:1}, {Tit1:4|4}, {Tit1:13|13}.","(2) The truth, the reality of the contents of the faith, mentioned in {1Ti2:4|1&nbsp;Tim. 2:4}, {1Ti2:7|7}; {1Ti3:15|3:15}; {1Ti4:3|4:3}; {1Ti6:5|6:5}; {2Ti2:15|2&nbsp;Tim. 2:15}, {2Ti2:18|18}, {2Ti2:25|25}; {2Ti3:7|3:7}, {2Ti3:8|8}; {2Ti4:4|4:4}; and {Tit1:1|Titus 1:1}, {Tit1:14|14}.","(3) Healthy teaching, in {1Ti1:10|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:10}, {2Ti4:3|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:3}, and {Tit1:9|Titus 1:9}; {Tit2:1|2:1}; healthy words, in {1Ti6:3|1&nbsp;Tim. 6:3} and {2Ti1:13|2&nbsp;Tim. 1:13}; healthy speech, in {Tit2:8|Titus 2:8}; and healthy in the faith, in {Tit1:13|Titus 1:13}; {Tit2:2|2:2}. All these are related to the condition of life.","(4) Life, the eternal life of God, in {1Ti1:16|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:16}; {1Ti6:12|6:12}, {1Ti6:19|19}; {2Ti1:1|2&nbsp;Tim. 1:1}, {2Ti1:10|10}; and {Tit1:2|Titus 1:2}; {Tit3:7|3:7}.","(5) Godliness, a living that is the expression of God, mentioned in {1Ti2:2|1&nbsp;Tim. 2:2}, {1Ti2:10|10} (godly); {1Ti3:16|3:16}; {1Ti4:7|4:7}, {1Ti4:8|8}; {1Ti5:4|5:4} (respect); {1Ti6:3|6:3}, {1Ti6:5|5}, {1Ti6:6|6}, {1Ti6:11|11}; {2Ti3:5|2&nbsp;Tim. 3:5}, {2Ti3:12|12} (godly); and {Tit1:1|Titus 1:1}; {Tit2:12|2:12} (godly). The opposite, ungodliness, is mentioned in {1Ti1:9|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:9} (ungodly), {2Ti2:16|2&nbsp;Tim. 2:16}, and {Tit2:12|Titus 2:12}.","(6) Faith, our act of believing in the gospel, in God, and in His word and deeds. It is subjective and is mentioned in {1Ti1:2|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:2}, {1Ti1:5|5}, {1Ti1:14|14}, {1Ti1:19|19}; {1Ti2:15|2:15}; {1Ti4:12|4:12}; {1Ti6:11|6:11}; {2Ti1:5|2&nbsp;Tim. 1:5}, {2Ti1:13|13}; {2Ti2:22|2:22}; {2Ti3:10|3:10}, {2Ti3:15|15}; and {Tit2:2|Titus 2:2}; {Tit3:15|3:15}.","(7) The conscience, the leading part of our spirit, which justifies or condemns our relationships with God and with man. It is mentioned in {1Ti1:5|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:5}, {1Ti1:19|19}; {1Ti3:9|3:9}; {1Ti4:2|4:2}; {2Ti1:3|2&nbsp;Tim. 1:3}; and {Tit1:15|Titus 1:15}.","The faith equals the contents of the economy, the household administration, the dispensation, of God. The truth is the contents, the reality, of the faith according to God&rsquo;s economy. Healthy teaching, healthy words, and healthy speech are the ministry of the truth, ministering to people the reality of the divine truths. Eternal life is the means and power to carry out the divine realities of the faith. Godliness is a living that expresses the divine reality, an expression of God in all His riches. Faith (subjective) is the response to the truth of the faith (objective); such faith receives and participates in the divine realities. The conscience is a test and a check to preserve us in the faith."]},

God&rsquo;s economy in faith is His household economy, His household administration (cf. {Eph1:10^1|note 10<sup>1</sup>} in {Eph1|Eph. 1}; {Eph3:9|Eph. 3:9}), which is to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people that He may have a house to express Himself, which house is the church ({1Ti3:15|3:15}), the Body of Christ.

According to the sequence of historical events, Christ&rsquo;s ascension preceded His being preached among the nations. However, it is listed here as the last step in Christ&rsquo;s being the manifestation of God in the flesh. This must indicate that the church too is taken up in glory. Hence, it implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head but also the church as the Body are the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in the first two chapters, with the oversight of the episcopate and the service of the deacons fully established, as revealed in {1Ti3|ch. 3}, the church will function as the house and household of the living God for His move on the earth, and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh.
