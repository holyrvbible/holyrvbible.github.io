As such, this book is a marvelous and vivid portrait, in poetic form, of the bridal love between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as His bride ({Joh3:29|John 3:29}-{Joh3:30|30}; {Rev19:7|Rev. 19:7}) in their mutual enjoyment in the mingling of His divine attributes with the human virtues of His lovers. Song of Songs stresses not the Body of Christ corporately but the believer in Christ individually, unveiling the progressive experience of an individual believer&rsquo;s loving fellowship with Christ in four stages, as shown in points I through IV of the outline of this book. The correspondence between the progression in the poem and the progression in the experience of Christ&rsquo;s lovers is the intrinsic revelation of the holy Word of the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent God. The stages of such a progression should be landmarks to us in the course of our pursuing of Christ for His and our mutual satisfaction.","In the romance between the great King Solomon and the girl from the countryside (cf. vv. {SoS1:5|5}-{SoS1:8|8}), because the two did not match each other, the king became a &ldquo;country man&rdquo; in order to go to her village to court her, to gain her love. On the one hand, he made himself the same as the country girl; on the other hand, he made the country girl a queen. This is a type of the story of God&rsquo;s romance with man. God as the Husband is divine, and the wife He desires to marry is human; the two do not match each other. To fulfill His heart&rsquo;s desire God became a lowly man with humanity in incarnation, and He contacted man by the way of a romance. Then in His resurrection He uplifted His humanity into His divinity in the divine power according to the Spirit of holiness, and He was designated the Son of God in His humanity ({Rom1:3|Rom. 1:3}-{Rom1:4|4} and {Rom1:3^1|notes}). Today He as the universal Bridegroom is the God-man, having both divinity and humanity. In order to make His bride, His wife, the same as He is, He regenerates His human elect, putting His divinity into their humanity and uplifting their humanity to the standard of divinity ({1Pe1:3|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3}, {1Pe1:23|23}; {Joh3:6|John 3:6}). After regenerating them, He then transforms His loving seekers gradually in their soul, and ultimately He transfigures them in their body, until in their entire being they are the same as He is in life, in nature, in image, and in function, but not in His Godhead ({Rom12:2|Rom. 12:2}; {2Co3:18|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18}; {Phi3:21|Phil. 3:21}; {1Jo3:2|1&nbsp;John 3:2}). The romance in Song of Songs portrays the process through which the seeker of Christ passes in order to become the Shulammite, a duplication of Solomon and a figure of the New Jerusalem.

The holy city Jerusalem was the capital of Judah and the safeguard of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the temple, on earth. Hence, these two cities signify God&rsquo;s sanctuary, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, with God&rsquo;s holy city surrounding it to be its safeguard. Here the Beloved&rsquo;s praising His lover, saying that she is as beautiful as the heavenly sanctuary (Tirzah) and as lovely as the heavenly Jerusalem, indicates that through her living in Christ&rsquo;s ascension as the new creation in resurrection, the lover of Christ becomes mature in the riches of the life of Christ so that she becomes not only a garden to Christ ({SoS4:12|4:12}&mdash;{SoS5:1|5:1}; {SoS6:2|6:2}) but also the building of God (cf. {Gen2:8|Gen. 2:8}-{Gen2:12|12}, {Gen2:18|18}-{Gen2:24|24}; {1Co3:9|1&nbsp;Cor. 3:9}-{1Co3:12|12}), the sanctuary of God and its safeguard. It indicates further that she lives in the Holy of Holies, the inner chamber of the heavenly sanctuary, within the veil, experiencing the ascension of Christ through the cross after her experience of His resurrection. To become a garden to Christ is to be flourishing in the element of Christ&rsquo;s life with its unsearchable riches; to become the sanctuary of God is to be built up (related to the building up of the Body of Christ) in the growth in the life of Christ with its unsearchable riches unto maturity ({Eph4:12|Eph. 4:12}-{Eph4:16|16}). In the Old Testament the building of God is typified by Tirzah and Jerusalem; in the New Testament this building is the organic Body of Christ. Ultimately, the building up of the organic Body of Christ, which is also Christ&rsquo;s wife ({Eph5:25|Eph. 5:25}-{Eph5:32|32}), will consummate the New Jerusalem, the holy city as the consummation of the Holy of Holies, the mutual dwelling of God and His redeemed in eternity ({Rev21:2|Rev. 21:2}-{Rev21:3|3}, {Rev21:16|16}, {Rev21:22|22}).","Although the sanctuary of God is in the heavens, it is divided into two sections&mdash;the outer Holy Place and the inner Holy of Holies, where God Himself dwells&mdash;by the veil, which signifies our flesh ({Heb9:1|Heb. 9:1}-{Heb9:5|5}, {Heb9:12|12}, {Heb9:24|24}; {Heb10:19|10:19}-{Heb10:20|20}). In relation to Christ, the veil in the sanctuary of God was split at the time of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion ({Mat27:51|Matt. 27:51}), but in relation to the believers, it still remains so that God may use it to perfect His seeking ones and so that they may be one with God by dwelling in Him as the Holy of Holies (see {Rev21:22|Rev. 21:22} and {Rev21:22^1|notes}). The apostle Paul became mature in the life of Christ, living in the ascension of Christ, yet God still allowed him to have a thorn in his flesh through a messenger of Satan to keep him from being exceedingly lifted up ({2Co12:7|2&nbsp;Cor. 12:7}). According to God&rsquo;s economy, no matter how mature and spiritual we may become, as long as we are living on earth, i.e., as long as our body has not yet been transfigured ({Rom8:23|Rom. 8:23}; {Phi3:21|Phil. 3:21}), we still have the flesh, which is the veil. Hence, there is still the need of the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate calling of us to live within the veil through a stronger experience of the cross in dealing with our flesh after we experience Christ&rsquo;s resurrection as the new creation of God. We need to learn to pass through the veil by experiencing the dealing of the cross every day that we may live within the veil, in the Holy of Holies. It is here that all the seekers of Christ who live in the Holy of Holies, in the consummated Triune God, enjoy to the fullest extent the hidden Christ in His hidden life supply (signified by the manna in the golden pot&mdash;{Exo16:32|Exo. 16:32}-{Exo16:34|34}; {Rev2:17|Rev. 2:17a}), in the resurrection life (signified by the budding rod&mdash;{Num17:1|Num. 17:1}-{Num17:11|11}), and in the inner law of life (signified by the tablets of the covenant&mdash;{Exo25:16|Exo. 25:16}; {Exo31:18|31:18}; {Deu10:1|Deut. 10:1}-{Deu10:5|5}; {Jer31:33|Jer. 31:33}) hidden in the Ark within the Holy of Holies ({Heb9:4|Heb. 9:4}).

A terrible army signifies that the overcomers of the Lord terrify God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan, and become terrible in the eyes of God&rsquo;s people.

The Shulammite works as Solomon&rsquo;s counterpart, taking care of all the vineyards ({SoS8:11|8:11}), the churches and the believers on the whole earth. This indicates that our work should be for the Body, not just one city. We must have a work that is for the entire world.

The vineyard keepers would pay Solomon one thousand shekels. Each vineyard keeper had helpers to keep the fruit, and he had to pay them two hundred shekels ({SoS8:12|v. 12}). In the work of Christ, Christ is the Lord of all the works (vineyards). We, as Christ&rsquo;s lovers, are vineyard keepers, who participate in one part of Christ&rsquo;s work. According to the Lord&rsquo;s requirement, we should pay Him the one thousand shekels, i.e., pay Him what He requires. In our work with the Lord we do not have &ldquo;helpers&rdquo;; hence, we as the vineyard keepers are able to keep the fruit ourselves. Thus, instead of giving the two hundred shekels to others, we give it to ourselves. This is the same as the Lord giving us two hundred shekels as a reward. Verses {SoS8:11|11}-{SoS8:12|12} show that our work with the Lord must exceed what He requires. The Lord requires not only what He has delivered to us but what He has given to us with interest ({Mat25:26|Matt. 25:26}-{Mat25:27|27}). With this interest as the basis, the Lord will reward us when He comes back.

Yet we as His lovers still should give Him as our Beloved what we should give, not as a duty but as a matter of love (cf. {Gal5:13|Gal. 5:13}). Christ as our Beloved, joining Himself to us as one, still likes to give us a reward of righteousness ({2Ti4:8|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:8}).
