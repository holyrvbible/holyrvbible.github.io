'3:13': 'For all the [a]firstborn are Mine; on the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified to Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast. They shall be Mine; I am Jehovah.',
'3:14': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,',
'3:15': 'Number the children of Levi by their fathers&rsquo; households, by their families; every male from a [a]month old and upward you shall number.',

'3:35': 'And the leader of the father&rsquo;s household of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. They shall encamp on the side of the tabernacle to the north.',
'3:36': 'And the appointed charge of the sons of Merari shall be the [a]boards of the tabernacle and its [b]bars and its [c]pillars and its [d]sockets and all its equipment and all the service pertaining to it,',
'3:37': 'And the [a]pillars around the court and their sockets and their [b]pegs and their cords.',
'3:38': 'And those who encamp before the tabernacle to the east, before the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise, shall be Moses and Aaron and his sons, keeping the [1]charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.',
'3:39': 'All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the commandment of Jehovah, by their families, all the males from a month old and upward were twenty-two thousand.',
'3:40': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.',
'3:41': 'And you shall [a]take the Levites for Me&mdash;I am Jehovah&mdash;instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the cattle of the children of Israel.',

'4:4': 'This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting concerning the most holy things.',
'4:5': 'When the camp [1]sets out, [2]Aaron and his sons shall go in, and they shall take down the [a]veil of the screen and cover the [b]Ark of the Testimony with it,',
'4:6': 'And they shall put on it a covering of [1a]porpoise skin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of [b]blue strands, and shall put in its [c]poles.',

'4:11': 'And over the golden [a]altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put in its poles.',
'4:12': 'And they shall take all the [a]utensils of ministry with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth, and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put them on the carrying frame.',
'4:13': 'And they shall remove the ashes from the altar, and spread a [a]purple cloth over it.',
'4:14': 'And they shall put upon it all its utensils with which they minister at it, the firepans, the forks, and the shovels, and the basins&mdash;all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread over it a covering of porpoise skin, and put in its poles.',
'4:15': 'And when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the furnishings of the sanctuary, whenever the camp sets out, then the sons of Kohath shall come to [a]carry them; but they shall not touch the holy things, or they will die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting.',
'4:16': 'And the oversight of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the [1a]oil for the light and the fragrant [b]incense and the continual meal offering and the [c]anointing oil, the oversight of all the tabernacle and all that is in it, the sanctuary and its furnishings.',
'4:17': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,',
'4:18': 'Do not let the tribe of the families of the Kohathites be cut off from among the Levites;',
'4:19': 'But do this to them that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and [1]assign each one of them to his service and to his burden;',
'4:20': 'But [1]the Kohathites shall not go in to [a]see the sanctuary even for a moment; otherwise they will die.',
'4:21': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'4:22': 'Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers&rsquo; households, by their families;',
'4:23': 'From thirty years old and upward to fifty years old you shall number them, everyone who enters to carry out the service to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.',
'4:24': 'This is the [a]service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in bearing burdens:',

'5:6': 'Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman commits any sin that men commit, so as to act unfaithfully toward Jehovah, and that person realizes his guilt,',
'5:7': 'Then they shall [1a]confess their sin which they have committed, and he shall [1]make restitution according to its principal for his wrong and add to it [b]one-fifth of it and give it to the one whom he has wronged.',
'5:8': 'But if the man has no [1]kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the wrong, the restitution which is made for the wrong goes to Jehovah for the priest, in addition to the [2a]ram of the expiation, by which expiation is made for him.',
'5:9': 'And every [a]heave offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.',
'5:10': 'And everyone&rsquo;s holy things shall be his; whatever anyone gives to the priest, it becomes his.',
'5:11': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',

'5:13': 'And a man lies with her and has sexual relations, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she is undetected, and she is defiled, and there is no witness against her since she was not caught in the act;',
'5:14': 'And a spirit of [1a]jealousy comes upon him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she has defiled herself; or if a spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he is jealous of his wife, and she has not defiled herself;',
'5:15': 'Then the man shall bring his wife to the [1]priest and bring her offering for her, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal. He shall pour [a]no oil upon it nor put frankincense on it; for it is a [2]meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance.',
'5:16': 'And the priest shall bring her near and set her before Jehovah.',
'5:17': 'And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and the priest shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it into the water.',
'5:18': 'And the priest shall set the woman before Jehovah and let the [1]hair of the woman&rsquo;s head go loose and put the meal offering of remembrance in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy, and in the hand of the priest shall be the water of bitterness that brings the curse.',
'5:19': 'And the priest shall make her take an oath and shall say to the woman, If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray to uncleanness while under the authority of your husband, be immune to this water of bitterness that brings the curse.',
'5:20': 'But if you have gone astray while under the authority of your husband and if you have defiled yourself, and a man besides your husband has lain with you&mdash;',
'5:21': 'Then the priest shall make the woman take an oath with the oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman&mdash;Jehovah make you a curse and an oath among your people, when Jehovah makes your thigh waste away and your womb swell;',
'5:22': 'And this water that brings the curse shall go into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh waste away. And the woman shall say, [1a]Amen, Amen.',
'5:23': 'And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall wash them off into the water of bitterness.',
'5:24': 'And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse; and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and become bitter.',
'5:25': 'And the priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman&rsquo;s hand, and he shall [1]wave the meal offering before Jehovah and bring it to the altar.',
'5:26': 'And the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering as its memorial portion and burn it upon the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water.',
'5:27': 'And when he has made her drink the water, then if she has defiled herself and has acted unfaithfully to her husband, the water that brings the curse will enter into her and become bitter, and her [1]womb will swell, and her [1]thigh will waste away; and the woman shall be a curse among her people.',
'5:28': 'But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she will be immune and able to conceive seed.',
'5:29': 'This is the law of jealousy when a wife, while under the authority of her husband, goes astray and defiles herself,',
'5:30': 'Or when the spirit of jealousy comes upon a man, and he is jealous of his wife. He shall set the woman before Jehovah, and the priest shall apply to her all this law.',
'5:31': 'And the man shall be free from iniquity, but that woman shall bear her iniquity.',
'6:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'6:2': 'Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When a man or a woman [1]makes a [a]special vow, the vow of a [2b]Nazarite, to [3]separate himself to Jehovah,',
'6:3': 'He shall separate himself from [1a]wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, nor shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh or dried grapes.',
'6:4': 'All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is produced by the grape vine, from the seeds even to the skin.',
'6:5': 'All the days of his vow of separation [a]no [1]razor shall pass over his head. He shall be holy until the days are fulfilled for which he separated himself to Jehovah; he shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.',
'6:6': '[a]All the days that he separates himself to Jehovah he shall not come near a [1]dead person.',
'6:7': 'He shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother, for his brother or for his sister, when they die, because [1]his separation to God is upon his head.',
'6:8': 'All the days of his separation he is holy to Jehovah.',
'6:9': 'And if anyone dies very [1]suddenly beside him so that he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall shave his head on the day he becomes clean; on the seventh day shall he [a]shave it.',
'6:10': 'And on the [1]eighth day he shall bring [a]two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,',
'6:11': 'And the priest shall offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering, and make expiation for him because he sinned by reason of the dead person. And he shall [1]sanctify his head that same day.',
'6:12': 'And he shall [1]separate to Jehovah the days of his separation and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering, but the former days shall be void because his separation was defiled.',
'6:13': 'Now this is the law of the Nazarite when the [1]days of his separation are [a]fulfilled: He shall be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.',
'6:14': 'And he shall present his offering to Jehovah: one [1a]male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one [2]female lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering, and one [3b]ram without blemish for a peace offering,',
'6:15': 'And a [1]basket of [a]unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and their meal offering and their [2b]drink offerings.',
'6:16': 'And the priest shall present them before Jehovah and offer his sin offering and his burnt offering.',
'6:17': 'And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah, with the basket of unleavened bread. The priest shall also offer its meal offering and its drink offering.',
'6:18': 'And the Nazarite shall [1a]shave the head of his separation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and take the hair of the head of his separation and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of peace offerings.',
'6:19': 'And the priest shall take the boiled [1]shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them into the hands of the Nazarite after he has shaved the head of his separation;',
'6:20': 'And the priest shall wave them for a [a]wave offering before Jehovah. It is holy for the priest, together with the breast of the wave offering and thigh of the heave offering. And afterward the Nazarite may drink wine.',
'6:21': 'This is the law of the Nazarite who vows, that is, of his offering to Jehovah for his separation, in addition to what he can afford; according to his vow which he vows, so he must do according to the law of his separation.',
'6:22': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'6:23': 'Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, Thus you shall [1a]bless the children of Israel; you shall say to them,',
'6:24': 'Jehovah [1a]bless you and [b]keep you;',

'7:7': 'Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of [a]Gershon according to their service;',

'9:8': 'And Moses said to them, Stay here so I may hear what Jehovah will command concerning you.',
'9:9': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'9:10': 'Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Any one of you or your descendants who becomes unclean through contact with a dead person or is on a distant journey shall still keep the passover to Jehovah.',
'9:11': 'In the [a]second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it; they shall eat it with [b]unleavened bread and bitter herbs.',
'9:12': 'They shall not leave any of it until the [a]morning, nor break a [b]bone of it; according to every statute of the passover they shall keep it.',
'9:13': 'But the [1]man who is clean and is not on a journey yet refrains from keeping the passover, that person shall be cut off from his people, because he did not present Jehovah&rsquo;s offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.',
'9:14': 'And if a [a]stranger sojourns with you and keeps the passover to Jehovah; according to the statute of the passover and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native born in the land.',

'9:21': 'If sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning, when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they set out; or if it remained a day and a night, when the cloud was taken up, they set out.',
'9:22': 'Whether it was two days or a month or a longer time that the cloud extended its time over the tabernacle and settled above it, the children of Israel remained encamped and did not set out; but when it was taken up, they set out.',
'9:23': 'At the commandment of Jehovah they encamped, and at the commandment of Jehovah they set out. They kept the charge of Jehovah according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.',
'10:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',

'10:8': 'And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall [a]blow the trumpets; and this shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations.',
'10:9': 'And when you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an [a]alarm with the trumpets, so that you may be remembered before Jehovah your God and be saved from your enemies.',
'10:10': 'Also on your days of rejoicing and at your [a]appointed feasts and at the beginnings of your months, you shall [1b]blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be a reminder on your behalf before your God; I am Jehovah your God.',
'10:11': 'Now it was in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was [a]taken up from over the Tabernacle of the Testimony.',
'10:12': 'And the children of Israel set out on their journeys from the wilderness of [a]Sinai. Then the cloud [1]settled down in the wilderness of [b]Paran.',
'10:13': 'And they set out for the first time according to the commandment of Jehovah through Moses.',
'10:14': '[a]And the standard of the camp of the children of Judah set out [b]first according to their companies; and over the entire company was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.',
'10:15': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar.',
'10:16': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.',
'10:17': 'And the tabernacle was [a]taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who [b]carried the tabernacle, set out.',
'10:18': 'And the standard of the camp of Reuben set out according to their companies; and over the entire company was Elizur the son of Shedeur.',
'10:19': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.',
'10:20': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.',
'10:21': 'And the Kohathites, who [a]carried the holy things, set out; and the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.',
'10:22': 'And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set out according to their companies; and over the entire company was Elishama the son of Ammihud.',
'10:23': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.',
'10:24': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.',
'10:25': 'And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set out according to their companies; and over the entire company was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.',
'10:26': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ochran.',
'10:27': 'And over the company of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.',
'10:28': 'This was the order in which the children of Israel set out according to their companies, when they set out.',
'10:29': 'And Moses said to [a]Hobab the son of [b]Reuel the Midianite, Moses&rsquo; father-in-law, We are setting out to the place concerning which Jehovah said, I will [c]give it to you. Come with us, and we will treat you well, for Jehovah has [d]promised good to Israel.',
'10:30': 'But he said to him, I will not go; but rather I will go to my own land and to my relatives.',
'10:31': 'So [1]Moses said, Please do not leave us, for you know where we can encamp in the wilderness, and you will be [2]eyes for us.',
'10:32': 'And if you go with us, whatever good Jehovah does for us, we will do for you.',
'10:33': 'So they set out from the [a]mountain of Jehovah three days&rsquo; journey, with the [1b]Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah setting out before them three days&rsquo; journey, to seek out a [c]resting place for them.',
'10:34': 'And the [a]cloud of Jehovah was over them by day when they set out from the camp.',
'10:35': 'And when the Ark set out, Moses said,<br>[1a]Rise up, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered;<br>And let those who hate You flee before You.',
'10:36': 'And when it came to rest, he said,<br>[1]Return, O [2]Jehovah, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.',
'11:1': 'And the people became like those who [a]murmur about their misfortune in the ears of Jehovah; and when Jehovah heard it, His [b]anger was kindled, and the [c]fire of Jehovah burned among them and consumed some at the outskirts of the camp.',
'11:2': 'And the people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Jehovah, and the fire abated.',
'11:3': 'And the name of that place was called [1]Taberah because the fire of Jehovah had burned among them.',
'11:4': 'And the [1a]mixed multitude that was among them [b]lusted exceedingly; and the children of Israel also wept again and said, Who shall give us meat to eat?',
'11:5': 'We remember the [1]fish which we used to eat in [a]Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic;',
'11:6': 'But now our appetite has gone; there is nothing at all but [1]this [a]manna to look at.',
'11:7': 'Now the manna was like [1a]coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.',
'11:8': 'The people went about and [a]gathered it and ground it between two millstones or beat it in a mortar; then they boiled it in pots and made cakes of it; and its [b]taste was like the taste of cakes baked in oil.',
'11:9': 'And when the [a]dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.',
'11:10': 'And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, each at the entrance of his tent; and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly, and Moses was displeased.',
'11:11': 'And Moses said to Jehovah, Why have You treated Your servant badly, and why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have put the burden of all this people upon me?',
'11:12': 'Did I conceive all this people? Or did I [a]bring them forth, so that You should say to me, Carry them in your [b]bosom, as a [c]nurse carries the nursing child, to the [d]land which You swore to give to their fathers?',
'11:13': 'From where should I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me, saying, Give us meat, so that we may eat!',
'11:14': 'I am not able to bear all this people [a]alone, for it is too heavy for me.',
'11:15': 'And if this is the way You deal with me, [a]please kill me at once&mdash;if I have found favor in Your sight&mdash;and do not let me see my wretchedness.',
'11:16': 'So Jehovah said to Moses, Gather to Me [1a]seventy, each one from the elders of Israel, whom you know are the elders of the people and their officers, and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, and have them stand there with you.',
'11:17': 'Then I will come down and talk with you there, and I will take of the [a]Spirit who is upon you and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the [b]burden of the people with you, so that you do not bear it alone.',
'11:18': 'And you shall say to the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who will give us meat to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt. Therefore Jehovah will give you meat, and you shall eat.',
'11:19': 'You shall [a]eat not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days,',
'11:20': 'But a whole month, until it comes out from your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected Jehovah who is among you and have wept before Him, saying, Why did we ever come out of Egypt?',
'11:21': 'But Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are [a]six hundred thousand on foot; and You have said, I will give them meat so that they may eat a whole month.',
'11:22': 'Will flocks and herds be slain for them, to satisfy them? Or will all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to satisfy them?',
'11:23': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, Has Jehovah&rsquo;s hand become [a]short? Now you will see whether My word will come to pass for you or not.',
'11:24': 'So Moses went out and told the people the words of Jehovah, and he gathered [a]seventy, each one from the elders of the people, and set them around the tent.',
'11:25': 'And Jehovah [a]came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and He took of the Spirit who was upon him, and put Him upon the seventy elders. And when the [b]Spirit rested upon them, they [1]prophesied, but they did not do so again.',
'11:26': 'But two men had remained in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad. And the Spirit rested upon them. (Now they were among those who were registered, but they had not gone out to the tent.) And they prophesied in the camp.',
'11:27': 'And a certain young man ran and told Moses and said, Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.',
'11:28': 'And Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, [a]restrain them!',
'11:29': 'But Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake? [a]Oh that [1]all Jehovah&rsquo;s people were prophets, that Jehovah would put His Spirit upon them!',
'11:30': 'And Moses returned to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.',
'11:31': 'And a wind went forth from Jehovah and brought [a]quails from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day&rsquo;s journey on this side and a day&rsquo;s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.',
'11:32': 'And the people rose up all that day and all the night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail. He who gathered least gathered ten homers. And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.',
'11:33': 'While the meat was still between their [a]teeth, before it was chewed, the [b]anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah struck the people with a very severe plague.',
'11:34': 'And the name of that place was called [1a]Kibroth-hattaavah because there they buried the people who [b]lusted.',
'11:35': '[a]From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.',
'12:1': 'And [a]Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had [b]married (for he had married a Cushite woman).',
'12:2': 'And they said, [1a]Has Jehovah indeed spoken only through Moses? Has He not also [b]spoken through us? And Jehovah heard it.',
'12:3': 'Now the man Moses was very [1a]meek, more than anyone else who was on the face of the earth.',
'12:4': 'And suddenly Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, You three come out to the Tent of Meeting. So the three of them came out.',
'12:5': '[a]Then Jehovah [1]came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent, and called Aaron and Miriam. And when they had both come forward,',
'12:6': 'He said, Hear now My words:<br>If there is a [1]prophet among you,<br>I, Jehovah, will make Myself known to him in a [a]vision;<br>I will speak with him in a [b]dream.',
'12:7': 'My servant Moses is not so;<br>[1a]He is faithful in all My house.',
'12:8': 'With him I speak [a]face to face, even openly, and not in riddles;<br>And he beholds the [b]form of Jehovah.<br>Why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses?',
'12:9': 'And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against them, and He departed.',
'12:10': 'And when the cloud had departed from over the tent; there [a]Miriam was, [1b]leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and there she was, leprous.',
'12:11': 'And Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please do not lay this sin upon us that we have so foolishly committed.',
'12:12': 'Please do not let her be like one dead, whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother&rsquo;s womb.',
'12:13': 'And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, [1]Please heal her, O God, please.',
'12:14': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, If her father had just spat in her face, would she not bear her shame seven days? Let her be shut up [a]outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.',
'12:15': 'So Miriam was shut up outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until Miriam had been brought in again.',
'12:16': 'After that the people set out from [a]Hazeroth and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.',
'13:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'13:2': '[1]Send men to [a]spy out the [2]land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; one man from each of their fathers&rsquo; tribes you shall send, every one a leader among them.',
'13:3': 'So Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Jehovah, all of them leading men among the children of Israel.',
'13:4': 'And these were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;',
'13:5': 'From the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori;',
'13:6': 'From the tribe of Judah, [a]Caleb the son of Jephunneh;',
'13:7': 'From the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph;',
'13:8': 'From the tribe of Ephraim, [a]Hoshea the son of Nun;',
'13:9': 'From the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;',
'13:10': 'From the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;',
'13:11': 'From the tribe of Joseph, that is, from the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi;',
'13:12': 'From the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;',
'13:13': 'From the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;',
'13:14': 'From the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;',
'13:15': 'From the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.',
'13:16': 'These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called [1]Hoshea the son of Nun [2a]Joshua.',
'13:17': 'And when Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, he said to them, Go up this way into the Negev, and go up into the hill country;',
'13:18': 'And see what the land is like; and whether the people who live in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;',
'13:19': 'And whether the land in which they dwell is good or bad; and whether the cities that they live in are like camps or with fortifications;',
'13:20': 'And whether the land is fat or lean; whether there are trees in it or not. Therefore strengthen yourselves and bring some of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.',
'13:21': 'So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, near the [1]entrance of Hamath.',
'13:22': 'And when they had gone up through the Negev, they came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of [1a]Anak, were there. (Now [b]Hebron was built seven years before [c]Zoan in Egypt.)',
'13:23': 'Then they came to the [a]Valley of Eshcol, and from there they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two of them. They also cut off some of the pomegranates and some of the figs.',
'13:24': 'That place was called the Valley of [1]Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.',
'13:25': 'And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.',
'13:26': 'And they proceeded to come to Moses and to Aaron and to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and they brought back word to them and to the whole assembly, and showed them the fruit of the land.',
'13:27': 'And they told him and said, We came to the land into which you sent us; and it indeed flows with [a]milk and honey, and this is its [b]fruit.',
'13:28': 'However, the [a]people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified and very large; and we also saw the descendants of Anak there.',
'13:29': 'The Amalekites dwell in the land of the Negev, and the Hittites and the Jebusites and the Amorites dwell in the hill country, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea and along the Jordan.',
'13:30': 'But [a]Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said, Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.',
'13:31': 'But the men who went up with him said, We are [a]not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we.',
'13:32': 'And they brought to the children of Israel an [a]evil report of the land which they had spied out, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of [b]great size.',
'13:33': 'And there we saw the [1a]Nephilim (the descendants of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.',
'14:1': 'Then the whole assembly lifted up their voice and cried, and the people wept that night.',
'14:2': 'And all the children of Israel [a]murmured against Moses and against Aaron; and the whole assembly said to them, If only we had died in the land of Egypt! Or if only we had died in this wilderness!',
'14:3': 'And why does Jehovah bring us into this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to [a]return to Egypt?',
'14:4': 'And they said one to another, Let us appoint a [a]captain, and let us return to Egypt.',
'14:5': 'Then Moses and Aaron [1a]fell on their faces before the whole congregation of the assembly of the children of Israel.',
'14:6': 'And [a]Joshua the son of Nun and [b]Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who spied out the land, [c]tore their clothes.',
'14:7': 'And they spoke to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we passed to spy out is an exceedingly [1a]good land.',
'14:8': 'If Jehovah is pleased with us, He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with [a]milk and honey.',
'14:9': 'Only [1]do not rebel against Jehovah, nor should you fear the people of the land, for they are our [a]bread. Their protection has been removed from them, and Jehovah is [b]with us; do not fear them.',
'14:10': 'But the whole assembly said to [a]stone them with stones. Then the [b]glory of Jehovah appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.',
'14:11': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, [1]How long will this people despise Me? And how long will they [a]not believe in Me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them?',
'14:12': 'I will strike them with pestilence and dispossess them, and I will make you into a [a]nation greater and mightier than they.',
'14:13': 'But Moses said to Jehovah, [1]Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your [a]might You brought this people up from their midst,',
'14:14': 'And they will tell the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, Jehovah, are in the midst of this people; for You, O Jehovah, are seen in plain sight, and Your cloud stands over them, and You go before them in a [a]pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night.',
'14:15': 'Now if You put this people to death as one man, then the nations that have heard the report about You will speak, saying,',
'14:16': '[a]Because Jehovah was not able to bring this people into the land which He swore to give them, He has therefore slaughtered them in the wilderness.',
'14:17': 'And now, I pray, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have spoken, saying,',
'14:18': 'Jehovah is [a]slow to anger and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generations.',
'14:19': '[a]Pardon, I pray, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You have forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.',
'14:20': 'Then Jehovah said, I have [1]pardoned them according to your word;',
'14:21': 'But as surely as I live, and as all the earth will be [a]filled with the glory of Jehovah,',
'14:22': 'None of those men who have seen My glory and My signs, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tried Me these ten times and have not listened to My voice,',
'14:23': 'Shall see the land which I [a]swore to give to their fathers, nor shall any of those who despised Me see it.',
'14:24': 'Only My servant [a]Caleb, because he had a different spirit and has [b]fully followed Me, will I bring into the land which he entered; and his descendants shall take possession of it.',
'14:25': 'Now since the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwell in the valleys, turn tomorrow, and set out into the wilderness by the way that leads to the Red Sea.',
'14:26': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,',
'14:27': 'How long shall I bear with this evil assembly, which [a]murmurs against Me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they are making against Me.',
'14:28': 'Say to them, As I live, declares Jehovah, just as you have spoken in My ears, so will I do to you.',
'14:29': 'Your corpses shall [a]fall in this wilderness, and none of you who were numbered, according to the number you counted from [b]twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against Me,',
'14:30': 'Shall come into the land, in which I [1a]swore to settle you, except [b]Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.',
'14:31': 'But your [a]little ones, whom you said would become plunder, I will bring in, and they will know the land which you have rejected.',
'14:32': 'But as for you, your corpses shall [a]fall in this wilderness.',
'14:33': 'And your children shall wander in the wilderness [a]forty years, and they shall suffer for your [1]unfaithfulness until your corpses have been consumed in the wilderness.',
'14:34': 'According to the number of the days which you spied out the land, [a]forty days, a year for every day, you shall bear your iniquities, forty years; and you shall know My [1]displeasure.',
'14:35': 'I, Jehovah, have spoken; surely I will do this to all this evil assembly who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be [a]consumed, and there they shall die.',
'14:36': 'And the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned and made the whole assembly to murmur against him by bringing up an [a]evil report against the land,',
'14:37': 'That is, those men who brought up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Jehovah.',
'14:38': 'Only [a]Joshua the son of Nun and [b]Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.',
'14:39': 'And when Moses spoke these words to all the children of Israel, the people mourned greatly.',
'14:40': 'And they rose up early in the morning to go up to the top of the mountain, saying, Here we are; now [a]we will go up to the place which Jehovah has spoken of, for we have sinned.',
'14:41': 'But Moses said, Why do you [1]again transgress the commandment of Jehovah? This will not succeed.',
'14:42': '[a]Do not go up&mdash;for Jehovah is not among you&mdash;so that you are not struck down before your enemies.',
'14:43': 'For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you shall fall by the sword. Because you have [1]turned back from following Jehovah, therefore Jehovah will not be with you.',
'14:44': 'But they [a]presumed to go up to the top of the mountain, even though neither the [1b]Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah nor Moses had departed out of the midst of the camp.',
'14:45': 'Then the [1a]Amalekites and the [1]Canaanites who dwelt in that hill country came down and struck them and beat them back as far as Hormah.',
'15:1': 'Then Jehovah [1]spoke to Moses, saying,',
'15:2': 'Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land that you are to inhabit, which I am giving you,',
'15:3': 'And you make an offering by fire to Jehovah, a [a]burnt [1]offering or a sacrifice, to [2]make a [b]special vow or as a freewill offering or at your appointed feasts, to make a [c]satisfying fragrance to Jehovah, from the herd or from the flock,',
'15:4': '[a]The one who presents his offering shall present to Jehovah a [b]meal offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a fourth of a hin of oil.',
'15:5': 'And you shall prepare wine for the [a]drink offering, a fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb.',
'15:6': 'Or for a ram you shall prepare as a meal offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with a third of a hin of oil;',
'15:7': 'And for the drink offering you shall present a third of a hin of wine, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.',
'15:8': 'And when you prepare a herd animal for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to make a special vow or for [a]peace offerings to Jehovah,',
'15:9': 'Then you shall offer with the herd animal a meal offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with half a hin of oil;',
'15:10': 'And you shall present for the drink offering half a hin of wine, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.',
'15:11': 'Thus shall it be done for each ox or for each ram or for each of the male lambs or goats.',
'15:12': 'According to the number that you prepare, so you shall do for every one according to their number.',
'15:13': 'All who are native shall do these things in this way, in presenting an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.',
'15:14': 'And if a stranger sojourns with you, or one who may be among you throughout your generations, and he wants to make an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah; just as you do, so he shall do.',
'15:15': 'For the congregation there shall be [1]one statute for you and for the [a]stranger who sojourns with you, a perpetual statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the sojourner be before Jehovah.',
'15:16': 'One law and one ordinance shall be for you and for the stranger who sojourns with you.',
'15:17': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'15:18': 'Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land into which I am bringing you,',
'15:19': 'Whenever you eat of the [a]bread of the land, you shall offer up a [b]heave offering to Jehovah.',
'15:20': 'From the [1a]first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a heave offering; as the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall you offer it up.',
'15:21': 'From the first of your dough you shall give to Jehovah a heave offering throughout your generations.',
'15:22': 'And if [1]you [a]sin unintentionally and do not observe all these commandments which Jehovah has spoken to Moses,',
'15:23': 'That is, everything that Jehovah has commanded you through Moses, from the day that Jehovah gave commandment and onward throughout your generations,',
'15:24': 'Then, if it was done unintentionally, without the knowledge of the assembly, the whole assembly shall offer one bull of the herd for a burnt offering, for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah, with its meal offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a [a]sin offering.',
'15:25': 'And the priest shall make [1a]expiation for the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven; for it was unintentional, and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to Jehovah, and their sin offering before Jehovah for their error.',
'15:26': 'And the whole assembly of the children of Israel shall be forgiven, and the stranger who sojourns among them; for all the people were involved unintentionally.',
'15:27': 'And if one person [a]sins unintentionally, then he shall present a female goat a year old for a sin offering.',
'15:28': 'And the priest shall make expiation before Jehovah for the person who sinned unintentionally, when he sins unintentionally, to make expiation for him; and he shall be forgiven.',
'15:29': 'You shall have one law for the one who does anything unintentionally, for one who is a native among the children of Israel and for the [a]stranger who sojourns among them.',
'15:30': 'But the person who does anything with a [1]high hand, whether a native or a sojourner, that one reviles Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from among his people.',
'15:31': 'Because he has despised the word of Jehovah and has broken His commandment, that person shall be completely cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him.',
'15:32': 'Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the [a]Sabbath day.',
'15:33': 'And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron and to the whole assembly.',
'15:34': 'And they put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.',
'15:35': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, The man shall surely be [1a]put to death; the whole assembly shall [b]stone him with stones outside the camp.',
'15:36': 'So the whole assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'15:37': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'15:38': 'Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to make for themselves [1a]fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations and to put on the fringe of each border a [2]cord of blue.',
'15:39': 'And it shall be a fringe for you, so that when you see it you will remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them, so that you do not seek after your own heart and your own eyes, according to which you committed fornication;',
'15:40': 'That you shall remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God.',
'15:41': 'I am [a]Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am Jehovah your God.',
'16:1': 'Now [a]Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with [b]Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, the sons of Reuben, took men',
'16:2': 'And rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, [1]two hundred fifty leaders of the assembly, who were summoned to the meeting, well-known men.',
'16:3': 'And they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much upon yourselves, for all the assembly are [a]holy, every one of them, and Jehovah is [b]among them. Why then do you [1]exalt yourselves above the congregation of Jehovah?',
'16:4': 'And when Moses heard this, he [a]fell on his face.',
'16:5': 'And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, [1]In the morning Jehovah will make known [a]who is His and who is holy, and will bring him near to Himself; even the one whom He will [b]choose He will bring near to Himself.',
'16:6': 'Do this: Take [a]censers for yourselves, Korah and all [1]your company,',
'16:7': 'And put fire in them, and put incense on them before Jehovah tomorrow; and the man whom Jehovah chooses, he shall be holy. It is you who take too much upon yourselves, O sons of Levi!',
'16:8': 'And Moses said to Korah, Hear now, O sons of Levi:',
'16:9': 'Is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has [a]separated you from the assembly of Israel to bring you near to Himself to do the [b]service of the tabernacle of Jehovah and to stand before the assembly to minister to them?',
'16:10': 'Or that He has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And do you seek the priesthood also?',
'16:11': 'Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Jehovah; but Aaron, [a]what is he that you [b]murmur against him?',
'16:12': 'Then Moses sent word to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab; but they said, We will not come up!',
'16:13': 'Is it not enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with [a]milk and honey to have us die in the wilderness, but must you also [b]lord it over us?',
'16:14': 'Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with [a]milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. [1]Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!',
'16:15': 'Then Moses became very angry and said to Jehovah, Do not [a]regard their offering. I have not taken a single [b]donkey from them, nor have I done harm to any of them.',
'16:16': 'And Moses said to Korah, You and all your company be present before Jehovah, both you and they along with Aaron, tomorrow.',
'16:17': 'And let each of you take his censer and put incense on them, and each of you present his censer before Jehovah, two hundred fifty censers; you also and Aaron shall each present his censer.',
'16:18': 'So each took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them, and they stood at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.',
'16:19': 'Thus Korah gathered the whole assembly against them at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and the [a]glory of Jehovah appeared to the whole assembly.',
'16:20': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,',
'16:21': '[a]Separate yourselves from among this assembly, so that I may consume them in a moment.',
'16:22': 'But they [a]fell on their faces and said, O God, the God of the [1b]spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and You be angry with the whole assembly?',
'16:23': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'16:24': 'Speak to the assembly, saying, Get away from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.',
'16:25': 'Then Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.',
'16:26': 'And he spoke to the assembly, saying, Depart now from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing which belongs to them, or you will be swept away with all their sins.',
'16:27': 'So they got away from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the entrance of their tents, with their wives and their children and their little ones.',
'16:28': 'And Moses said, By this you shall know that Jehovah has [a]sent me to do all these works, for it is not of myself.',
'16:29': 'If these people die as all human beings die, or if what befalls all human beings befalls them, then Jehovah has not sent me.',
'16:30': 'But if Jehovah brings about a [a]new thing, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they descend alive into [1]Sheol, then you will understand that these men have despised Jehovah.',
'16:31': 'And as soon as he finished speaking all these words, the ground that was under them was split open.',
'16:32': 'So the earth opened its mouth and [a]swallowed them up, along with their households and everyone who belonged to [b]Korah and all their possessions.',
'16:33': 'So they and all that belonged to them [1]descended alive into Sheol; and the earth [a]closed over them, and they perished from the midst of the congregation.',
'16:34': 'And all Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, The earth may swallow us up too!',
'16:35': 'And [a]fire came forth from Jehovah and [1b]consumed the two hundred fifty men who presented the incense.',
'16:36': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'16:37': 'Tell [a]Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take the censers up out of the burning and scatter the fire about; for they are holy.',
'16:38': 'The censers of those who have sinned against their own lives, let them be made into beaten plates for a [a]covering of the [1]altar, for they presented them before Jehovah and they became holy. So they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.',
'16:39': 'And Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which those who were burned had offered; and they beat them out as a covering of the altar,',
'16:40': 'As a reminder to the children of Israel that no stranger who is not of the seed of [a]Aaron may come near to [b]burn incense before Jehovah, so that he does not become like Korah and his company, just as Jehovah had spoken to him through Moses.',
'16:41': 'But on the next day the whole assembly of the children of Israel [1a]murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have caused the people of Jehovah to die.',
'16:42': 'But when the assembly gathered against Moses and against Aaron, they looked toward the Tent of Meeting, and there the [a]cloud was, covering it; and the [b]glory of Jehovah appeared.',
'16:43': 'And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.',
'16:44': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'16:45': '[a]Get away from the midst of this assembly that I might consume them in a moment. And they [b]fell upon their faces.',
'16:46': 'And Moses said to Aaron, Take the censer and put [a]fire in it from the altar, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the assembly, and make [1b]expiation for them. For wrath has gone forth from Jehovah; the plague has begun.',
'16:47': 'And Aaron took it as Moses had said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And indeed the plague had begun among the people. So he put on the incense and made expiation for the people.',
'16:48': 'And he stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was [a]stopped.',
'16:49': 'Now those who [a]died by the plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those who died on account of Korah.',
'16:50': 'So Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting when the plague had been stopped.',
'17:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'17:2': 'Speak to the children of Israel, and take from them [1a]rods, one for each father&rsquo;s house, twelve rods from all their leaders according to their fathers&rsquo; houses; you shall write everyone&rsquo;s name upon his rod.',
'17:3': 'And you shall write Aaron&rsquo;s name upon the [a]rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of each of their fathers&rsquo; houses.',
'17:4': 'And you shall place them in the Tent of Meeting before the [1]Testimony, where I [a]meet with you.',
'17:5': 'And the rod of the man whom I [a]choose shall bud, and I will put a stop to the murmurings of the children of Israel against Me, which they [b]murmur against you.',
'17:6': 'So Moses spoke to the children of Israel. And every one of their leaders gave him a rod, one rod for each leader according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, twelve rods, with the rod of Aaron among their rods.',
'17:7': 'And Moses placed the rods before Jehovah in the Tent of the Testimony.',
'17:8': 'And on the next day Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony, and there was the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi: it had [1]budded; it even put forth buds and produced blossoms and bore ripe [a]almonds.',
'17:9': 'And Moses brought out all the rods from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel, and they looked; and each one took his rod.',
'17:10': 'Then Jehovah said to Moses, [1]Put back the rod of Aaron before the Testimony to be kept as a [a]sign against the rebels, so that you may put an end to their murmurings against Me, and they not die.',
'17:11': 'And Moses did so; just as Jehovah commanded him, so he did.',
'17:12': 'And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Alas, we [1]die out; we perish; all of us perish.',
'17:13': 'Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of Jehovah, dies. Are we to completely die out?',
'18:1': 'Then Jehovah [1]said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father&rsquo;s household with you shall [a]bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and you and your sons with you shall bear the [2]iniquity of your priesthood.',
'18:2': 'And your brothers also, the tribe of [1]Levi, the tribe of your father, bring near with you, so that they may be joined to you and [a]minister to you, while you and your sons with you are before the Tent of the Testimony.',
'18:3': 'And they shall keep your charge and the charge of all the [a]tent, but they shall [b]not come near to the furnishings of the sanctuary and to the altar, so that they do not die, neither they nor you.',
'18:4': 'And they shall be joined to you and keep the charge of the Tent of Meeting for all the service of the tent, but a stranger shall not come near to you.',
'18:5': 'And you shall keep the charge of the [1]sanctuary and the charge of the [1]altar, so that there may be no more wrath upon the children of Israel.',
'18:6': 'And I Myself have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel. They are a [1a]gift to you, given to Jehovah, to do the service of the Tent of Meeting.',
'18:7': 'But you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar and [a]within the veil, and you shall carry out your service. I give you the [b]priesthood as a service of [1]gift, but the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.',
'18:8': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Aaron, And I Myself have given you charge of My heave offerings, even all the holy things of the children of Israel; I have given them to you because of the [a]anointing, and to your sons, as a perpetual statute.',
'18:9': 'This shall be yours of the most holy things, [1]kept from the fire. Every offering of theirs, even every [a]meal [2]offering of theirs and every [b]sin offering of theirs and every [c]trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render to Me, shall be [3]most holy for you and for your sons.',
'18:10': 'As the most holy things you shall [a]eat it; every [1]male shall eat it; it shall be holy to you.',
'18:11': 'This also is yours, the [a]heave offering of their gift, even all the [b]wave offerings of the children of Israel. I have given them to [c]you and to your [1]sons and to your [1]daughters with you, as a perpetual statute; everyone who is clean in your house may [d]eat it.',
'18:12': 'All the [1]best of the [a]oil, and all the [1]best of the new wine and of the grain, their [b]firstfruits that they give to Jehovah, I have given to you.',
'18:13': 'The firstfruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to Jehovah, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.',
'18:14': 'Everything [a]devoted in Israel shall be yours.',
'18:15': 'Everything that [a]opens the womb of all flesh, which they present to Jehovah, whether human or animal, shall be yours; nevertheless the firstborn of human beings you shall surely [1b]redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.',
'18:16': 'And those who are to be redeemed from a month old you shall redeem, according to your estimation, for [a]five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.',
'18:17': 'But the [a]firstborn of a cow or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood upon the altar and burn their fat as an offering by fire for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.',
'18:18': 'But their flesh shall be yours; like the breast of the [a]wave offering and like the right thigh, it shall be yours.',
'18:19': 'All the [a]heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to Jehovah, I have given to you and to your sons and your daughters with you, as a perpetual statute. It is a [1b]covenant of salt forever before Jehovah for you and for your descendants with you.',
'18:20': 'And Jehovah said to Aaron, [a]You shall have [1]no inheritance in their land, nor shall you have any portion among them; I am your [b]portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.',
'18:21': 'And to the children of Levi I have now given every [1a]tithe in Israel for an inheritance in return for their service which they carry out, the service of the Tent of Meeting.',
'18:22': 'From now on the children of Israel shall not come near the Tent of Meeting, so that they do not incur sin and die.',
'18:23': 'But the Levites shall do the [a]service of the Tent of Meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations. And among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.',
'18:24': 'For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave offering to Jehovah, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.',
'18:25': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'18:26': 'Moreover you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, When you take from the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them as your inheritance, then you shall offer up a [1a]heave offering from it for Jehovah, a [b]tithe of the tithe.',
'18:27': 'And your heave offering shall be reckoned to you as though it were the grain of the threshing floor and the fullness of the wine press.',
'18:28': 'Thus you shall also offer a heave offering to Jehovah from all your tithes, which you receive from the children of Israel; and from it you shall give [a]Jehovah&rsquo;s heave offering to [1]Aaron the priest.',
'18:29': 'Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of Jehovah, from all the best of it, the sanctified portion of it from them.',
'18:30': 'Therefore you shall say to them, When you heave from it the best of it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as though it were the produce of the threshing floor and the produce of the wine press.',
'18:31': 'And you may [a]eat it in every place, you and your households, for it is your [1]reward in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting.',
'18:32': 'And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it. But you shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, so that you do not die.',
'19:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,',
'19:2': 'This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded, saying, Tell the children of Israel to bring you a [1]red [a]heifer without defect, in which is no blemish and upon which a [b]yoke has never come.',
'19:3': 'And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and someone shall bring it [1a]outside the camp and slaughter it in his presence.',
'19:4': 'And Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and [a]sprinkle its blood toward the front of the Tent of Meeting seven times.',
'19:5': 'And the heifer shall be [a]burned in his sight; its skin and its flesh and its blood, with its dung, shall be burned.',
'19:6': 'And the priest shall take [1a]cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet strands, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer.',
'19:7': 'Then the priest shall [a]wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; but the priest shall be unclean until the evening.',
'19:8': 'And he who burns [1]the heifer shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until the evening.',
'19:9': 'And a man who is clean shall gather up the [1a]ashes of the heifer and place them outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the assembly of the children of Israel as [b]water for [2]impurity; it is a sin offering.',
'19:10': 'And he who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be a perpetual statute to the children of Israel and to the stranger who sojourns among them.',
'19:11': 'One who touches the [a]dead body of any human being shall be unclean seven days.',
'19:12': 'He shall [a]purify himself with it on the [1]third day and on the [1]seventh day, and then he shall be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he shall not be clean.',
'19:13': 'Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a human being who has died, and does not purify himself, [a]defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the [b]water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.',
'19:14': 'This is the law when a man dies in a tent: Anyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be unclean seven days.',
'19:15': 'And every open vessel, which has no covering tied down on it, is unclean.',
'19:16': 'And whoever in the open field touches one who has been slain with a sword or a dead body or a human bone or a grave shall be unclean seven days.',
'19:17': 'And for the unclean they shall take of the [a]ashes of the burning of the sin offering, and [1]running water shall be added to them in a vessel;',
'19:18': 'And a clean person shall take [a]hyssop, and dip it in the water, and [b]sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the persons who were there, or on the one who touched the bone or the one slain or the one who died or the grave.',
'19:19': 'And the clean person shall [a]sprinkle on the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day, and on the seventh day he shall purify him. And he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean in the evening.',
'19:20': 'But the man who shall be unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of Jehovah; the [a]water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.',
'19:21': 'So it shall be a perpetual statute for them. And he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.',
'19:22': 'And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person who touches it shall be unclean until evening.',
'20:1': 'Then the children of Israel, the whole assembly, came to the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed at Kadesh; and [a]Miriam [1]died there and was buried there.',
'20:2': 'And there was [a]no [1]water for the assembly, and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.',
'20:3': 'And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying, If only we had expired when our brothers expired before Jehovah!',
'20:4': 'Why then have you brought the congregation of Jehovah into this wilderness for us and our livestock to die there?',
'20:5': 'Why then did you bring us up out of Egypt, to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a [a]place of grain or figs or vines or pomegranates, and there is not even water to drink.',
'20:6': 'And Moses and Aaron went from before the congregation to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and [a]fell upon their faces, and the [b]glory of Jehovah appeared to them.',
'20:7': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'20:8': 'Take the [a]rod, and gather the assembly, you and Aaron your brother, and speak to the [1b]rock before their eyes, so that it yields its [1]water. Thus you shall bring forth water for them out of the rock and give the assembly and their livestock something to [c]drink.',
'20:9': 'And Moses took the [a]rod from before Jehovah, as He had commanded him.',
'20:10': 'And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he [a]said to them, Listen now, you [1b]rebels: Shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?',
'20:11': 'Then Moses lifted up his hand and [a]struck the rock with his rod twice; and abundant water came forth, and the assembly and their livestock drank.',
'20:12': 'And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe in Me, to [1a]sanctify Me in the sight of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this congregation [b]into the land which I have given them.',
'20:13': 'These are the waters of [1a]Meribah, where the children of Israel contended with Jehovah, and He was sanctified among them.',
'20:14': 'Now Moses sent messengers from [a]Kadesh to the king of [1]Edom: Thus says your brother Israel, You know all the hardship that has befallen us;',
'20:15': 'How our fathers went down to [a]Egypt, and we [b]dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians [c]ill-treated us and our fathers;',
'20:16': 'And when we [a]cried to Jehovah, He heard our voice and sent an [b]Angel and brought us forth out of Egypt; and now we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your border.',
'20:17': 'Please [a]let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or through vineyard, nor will we drink water from any well; we will go along the King&rsquo;s Highway, not turning aside to the right or to the left, until we pass through your territory.',
'20:18': 'But Edom said to him, You shall not pass through [1]my territory, or else I will come out against you with the sword.',
'20:19': 'Then the children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway, and if I and my livestock drink some of your water, then I will pay its price. Allow me only this one thing, to pass through on foot.',
'20:20': 'However he said, You shall not pass through. And Edom came out against him with a large number of people and with a mighty hand.',
'20:21': 'So Edom [a]refused to give Israel passage through his territory, and Israel turned away from him.',
'20:22': 'Now when they [a]journeyed from Kadesh, the children of Israel, the whole assembly, came to Mount Hor.',
'20:23': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron at Mount Hor, on the border of the land of Edom, saying,',
'20:24': 'Aaron shall be [a]gathered to his people, for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you [b]rebelled against My word at the waters of Meribah.',
'20:25': 'Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up Mount Hor;',
'20:26': 'And strip Aaron of his [a]garments and put them upon Eleazar his son; so Aaron will be gathered to his people, and will die there.',
'20:27': 'So Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded, and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of the whole assembly.',
'20:28': 'And when Moses had stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son, Aaron [1a]died there on the top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.',
'20:29': 'And when the whole assembly saw that Aaron had expired, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron [a]thirty days.',
'21:1': 'And when the [1a]Canaanite, the king of [2]Arad, who dwelt in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.',
'21:2': 'And Israel made a [a]vow to Jehovah and said, If You will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will [b]utterly destroy their cities.',
'21:3': 'And Jehovah listened to the voice of Israel and delivered up the Canaanites, and they utterly destroyed them and their cities. Thus the name of the place was called [1]Hormah.',
'21:4': 'Then they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to go [a]around the land of Edom; and [1]the people became impatient on the way.',
'21:5': 'And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no food and there is no water; and our soul loathes this [1a]light bread.',
'21:6': 'Then Jehovah sent fiery [a]serpents among the people, and they bit the people, so that many people of Israel died.',
'21:7': 'And the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, because we have spoken against Jehovah and against you; pray to Jehovah, that He may take away the serpents from us. So Moses prayed for the people.',
'21:8': 'Then Jehovah said to Moses, Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a [1]pole; and everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live.',
'21:9': 'And Moses made a [1a]bronze serpent and set it on the pole; and if a serpent had bitten any man, when he [b]looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.',
'21:10': '[a]And the children of Israel journeyed and encamped at Oboth.',
'21:11': 'And they journeyed from Oboth and encamped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness which faces Moab toward the sunrise.',
'21:12': 'From there they journeyed and encamped in the valley of [a]Zered.',
'21:13': 'From there they [a]journeyed and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the border of the Amorites; for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.',
'21:14': 'Therefore it is said in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah,<br>Waheb in Suphah,<br>And the valleys of the Arnon,',
'21:15': 'And the slope of the valleys<br>That inclines toward the seat of Ar<br>And leans toward the border of Moab.',
'21:16': 'And from there they journeyed to [1]Beer; that is the well where Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them [a]water.',
'21:17': 'Then Israel sang this song:<br>Spring up, O well! Sing to it!',
'21:18': 'The well, which the [1]leaders sank,<br>Which the [1]nobles of the people dug,<br>With the scepter, with their staffs.<br>And from the wilderness they journeyed to Mattanah;',
'21:19': 'And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;',
'21:20': 'And from Bamoth to the valley that is in the land of Moab, to the top of [a]Pisgah, which looks down upon the desert.',
'21:21': 'And Israel [a]sent messengers to Sihon the king of the [1]Amorites, saying,',
'21:22': '[a]Let me pass through your land. We will not turn aside into field or into vineyard; we will not drink water from any well. We will go by the King&rsquo;s Highway until we have passed through your territory.',
'21:23': '[a]But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his territory. And Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.',
'21:24': 'And Israel [a]struck him with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.',
'21:25': 'And Israel took all these cities, and Israel settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all her villages.',
'21:26': 'For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon.',
'21:27': 'Therefore those who speak in proverbs say,<br>Come to Heshbon; let it be built,<br>And let the city of Sihon be established.',
'21:28': '[a]For fire has gone forth from Heshbon,<br>A flame from the city of Sihon;<br>It has consumed Ar of Moab<br>[1]And swallowed up the high places of the Arnon.',
'21:29': 'Woe to you, O Moab!<br>You have perished, O people of Chemosh;<br>He has given his sons as fugitives,<br>And his daughters have gone into captivity,<br>To an Amorite king, Sihon.',
'21:30': 'We have shot at them;<br>Heshbon is ruined as far as Dibon,<br>And we have laid waste as far as Nophah,<br>[1]Fire spreads as far as Medeba.',
'21:31': 'Thus Israel settled in the land of the Amorites.',
'21:32': 'And Moses sent some to [a]spy out Jazer. And they captured its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.',
'21:33': 'And they turned and went up on the way that leads to Bashan; and [a]Og the king of [1]Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, for battle at Edrei.',
'21:34': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who was dwelling at Heshbon.',
'21:35': 'So they struck him and his sons and all his people until there was no survivor left to him, and they possessed his land.',
'22:1': 'And the children of Israel [a]journeyed and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.',
'22:2': 'And [a]Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.',
'22:3': 'And Moab was very afraid of the people because they were many, and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.',
'22:4': 'And [1]Moab said to the elders of [1]Midian, This multitude will now lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. Now Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.',
'22:5': 'And he sent messengers to [1a]Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the [2]River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, There is a people here who have come out from Egypt; now they cover the surface of the land and have settled over against me.',
'22:6': 'Now, therefore, please come; [a]curse this people for me, since they are mightier than I. Perhaps I may be able to strike them and drive them out of the land, for I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed.',
'22:7': 'So the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with fees for divination in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.',
'22:8': 'And he said to them, Spend tonight here, and I will bring back word to you as [1]Jehovah speaks to me. And the rulers of Moab stayed with Balaam.',
'22:9': 'And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?',
'22:10': 'And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, has sent word to me, saying,',
'22:11': '[a]There is a people who came out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land. Now come; curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them and drive them out.',
'22:12': 'And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not [1]curse the people, for they are [1a]blessed.',
'22:13': 'So Balaam rose up in the morning and said to the rulers from Balak, Go to your land, for Jehovah has refused to let me go with you.',
'22:14': 'And the rulers of Moab rose up and went to Balak and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.',
'22:15': 'So Balak yet again sent rulers, more numerous and more honorable than these.',
'22:16': 'And they came to Balaam and said to him, Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me,',
'22:17': 'For I will indeed honor you greatly; and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore; curse this people for me.',
'22:18': '[a]And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah my God, to do less or more.',
'22:19': 'Now you therefore please stay here tonight also, so that I may know what more Jehovah might speak to me.',
'22:20': 'And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, Since the men have come to call you, rise up; [1]go with them, but only what I speak to you shall you do.',
'22:21': 'And Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the rulers of Moab.',
'22:22': 'And God&rsquo;s anger was kindled because he was going, and the [1a]Angel of Jehovah took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.',
'22:23': 'And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, the donkey turned aside out of the way and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back into the way.',
'22:24': 'Then the Angel of Jehovah stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on this side and a wall on that side.',
'22:25': 'And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she pressed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam&rsquo;s foot against the wall. So he struck her again.',
'22:26': 'And the Angel of Jehovah went further and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.',
'22:27': 'And when the donkey saw the Angel of Jehovah, she lay down under Balaam. Then Balaam&rsquo;s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.',
'22:28': 'And Jehovah opened the mouth of the [a]donkey, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?',
'22:29': 'And Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me! If I had a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now.',
'22:30': 'And the donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you? And he said, No.',
'22:31': 'Then Jehovah opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the [a]Angel of Jehovah standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand, and he bowed his head and fell on his face.',
'22:32': 'And the Angel of Jehovah said to him, Why have you struck your donkey these three times? I am here, having come out as an adversary, because your way was unrestrained before Me.',
'22:33': 'And the donkey saw Me and turned aside before Me these three times. If she had not turned aside from Me, I would surely have killed you just now and let her live.',
'22:34': 'And Balaam said to the Angel of Jehovah, I have sinned, for I did not know that You were standing in the way against me. Now then, if it displeases You, I will turn back.',
'22:35': 'And the Angel of Jehovah said to Balaam, Go with the men; but you shall speak only the word that I shall speak to you. So Balaam went with the rulers from Balak.',
'22:36': 'And when Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, at the farthest point of the border.',
'22:37': 'And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not send word urgently to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not indeed able to [a]honor you?',
'22:38': 'And Balaam said to Balak, Here I am; I have come to you now. Am I able to speak anything at all? [a]The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.',
'22:39': 'And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.',
'22:40': 'And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent them to Balaam and to the rulers who were with him.',
'22:41': 'And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to [1]Bamoth-baal, and he saw from there the [a]edge of the people.',
'23:1': '[a]Then Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here.',
'23:2': 'And Balak did just as Balaam had spoken. And Balak and Balaam [1]offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.',
'23:3': 'And Balaam said to Balak, Stand near your burnt offering, and I will go; perhaps Jehovah will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you. And he went to a bare height.',
'23:4': '[a]And God met Balaam, and he said to Him, I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.',
'23:5': 'And Jehovah put a word in Balaam&rsquo;s mouth and said, Return to Balak, and you shall speak this.',
'23:6': 'When he returned to him, there he was, standing beside his burnt offering, he and all the rulers of Moab.',
'23:7': 'And he took up his [1]parable and said,<br>From Aram Balak brought me,<br>The king of Moab from the mountains of the East.<br>Come, [a]curse Jacob for me;<br>And come, denounce Israel!',
'23:8': 'How shall I curse whom God has [a]not cursed?<br>And how can I denounce whom Jehovah has not denounced?',
'23:9': 'For from the top of the rocks I see him,<br>And from the hills I behold him.<br>Here is a people who live [1a]alone<br>And do not reckon themselves among the nations.',
'23:10': 'Who can [a]count the [1]dust of Jacob,<br>Or number the fourth part of Israel?<br>Let [2]me die the death of the upright,<br>And let my latter end be like theirs!',
'23:11': 'And Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed them.',
'23:12': 'And he answered and said, [a]Shall I not take care to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?',
'23:13': '[a]And Balak said to him, Come now with me to another place from which you may see them. You will see only the outside edge of them and not see them all; then curse them for me from there.',
'23:14': 'So he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of [a]Pisgah, and built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.',
'23:15': 'And he said to Balak, Stand here near your burnt offering while I meet Jehovah there.',
'23:16': '[a]And Jehovah met Balaam and put a word in his mouth and said, Return to Balak, and you shall speak this.',
'23:17': 'When he came to him, there he was, standing beside his burnt offering, and the rulers of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, What has Jehovah spoken?',
'23:18': 'And he took up his parable and said,<br>Arise, O Balak, and hear;<br>Listen to me, O son of Zippor:',
'23:19': '[a]God is not a man, that He should [1]lie,<br>Nor a son of man, that He should repent.<br>Has He said, and will He not do it?<br>Or has He spoken, and will He not establish it?',
'23:20': 'Now I have received a word to bless;<br>Since He has [a]blessed, then I cannot reverse it.',
'23:21': 'He has not beheld [1a]iniquity in Jacob,<br>Nor has He seen trouble in Israel;<br>[b]Jehovah their God is with them,<br>And the shout of a [2]king is among them.',
'23:22': '[a]God is the One who brought them forth out of Egypt;<br>[1]He has as it were the [2b]horns of the wild ox.',
'23:23': 'Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob,<br>Nor is there any divination against Israel.<br>Now it shall be said of Jacob<br>And of Israel, What has God [a]wrought!',
'23:24': 'See, a people rises up like a lioness,<br>And like a [a]lion they lift themselves up.<br>They shall not lie down until they eat the prey<br>And drink the blood of the slain.',
'23:25': 'And Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.',
'23:26': 'But Balaam answered and said to Balak, Did I not tell you, saying, [a]All that Jehovah speaks, that I must do?',
'23:27': '[a]And Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place; perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.',
'23:28': 'And Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which looks down upon the desert.',
'23:29': '[a]And Balaam said to Balak, Build me seven altars here, and have seven bulls and seven rams ready for me here.',
'23:30': 'And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on each altar.',
'24:1': 'And when Balaam saw that it pleased Jehovah to bless Israel, he did [a]not go as at the other times to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.',
'24:2': 'And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, and the [a]Spirit of God came upon him.',
'24:3': '[a]And he took up his parable and said,<br>Balaam the son of Beor declares,<br>And the man whose eye is [1]opened declares;',
'24:4': 'He declares, he who hears the words of God,<br>Who sees the vision of the [a]All-sufficient One,<br>Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:',
'24:5': '[a]How [1]fair are your tents, O Jacob,<br>Your tabernacles, O Israel!',
'24:6': 'Like [1]valleys they are spread forth,<br>Like [a]gardens beside a river,<br>Like [2b]aloes which Jehovah has planted,<br>Like cedars beside [c]water.',
'24:7': 'Water shall flow from his buckets,<br>And his seed shall be in many waters,<br>And his [1]king shall be higher than [a]Agag,<br>And his kingdom shall be exalted.',
'24:8': '[a]God is the One who brought him forth out of Egypt;<br>He has as it were the [1]horns of the wild ox.<br>He shall eat up the nations, his adversaries,<br>And shall break their bones in pieces,<br>And shatter them with his arrows.',
'24:9': '[a]He couches; he lies down like a lion<br>And like a lioness; who will rouse him up?<br>[1b]Blessed is everyone who blesses you,<br>And cursed is everyone who curses you.',
'24:10': 'Then Balak&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to [a]curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed them these three times.',
'24:11': 'Therefore now flee to your place! I said I would greatly [a]honor you, but now Jehovah has kept you away from honor.',
'24:12': '[a]And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying,',
'24:13': 'Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad from my own heart? What Jehovah speaks, that I will speak.',
'24:14': 'And now therefore, I am going to my people. Come, let me give you counsel as to what this people will do to your people in the last days.',
'24:15': '[a]And he took up his parable and said,<br>Balaam the son of Beor declares,<br>And the man whose eye is opened declares;',
'24:16': 'He declares, he who hears the words of God<br>And obtains the knowledge of the [a]Most High,<br>Who sees the vision of the [b]All-sufficient One,<br>Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered:',
'24:17': 'I see Him, but not now;<br>I behold Him, but not near.<br>There shall [1]come forth a [2a]Star out of Jacob,<br>And a [2b]Scepter shall rise out of Israel,<br>And He shall crush the corners of [c]Moab<br>And break down all the sons of Sheth.',
'24:18': 'And [a]Edom shall be dispossessed&mdash;<br>Seir, His [1]enemies, shall also be dispossessed&mdash;<br>While Israel does valiantly.',
'24:19': 'And One from Jacob shall have dominion<br>And destroy the remnant from [1]the city.',
'24:20': 'And he looked on [1]Amalek and took up his parable and said,<br>[a]Amalek was the first of the nations,<br>But his latter end shall come to destruction.',
'24:21': 'And he looked on the Kenites and took up his parable and said,<br>Strong is your dwelling place,<br>And your nest is set in the rock.',
'24:22': 'Nevertheless Kain shall be burned<br>Until [a]Asshur carry you away captive.',
'24:23': 'And he took up his parable and said,<br>Alas, who shall live when God does this?',
'24:24': 'But ships shall come from the coast of [a]Kittim,<br>And they shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber;<br>And he also shall come to destruction.',
'24:25': 'And Balaam rose up and went back to his place, and Balak also went his way.',
'25:1': 'While Israel dwelt in Shittim, the people began to commit [1a]fornication with the daughters of Moab.',
'25:2': 'For they invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people [a]ate and bowed down to their gods.',
'25:3': 'And Israel joined itself to [a]Baal-peor, and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Israel.',
'25:4': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, Take all the leaders of the people and [a]hang them up to Jehovah before the sun, so that the fierce anger of Jehovah may turn away from Israel.',
'25:5': 'And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Each of you [a]slay his men who have joined themselves to Baal-peor.',
'25:6': 'Just then one of the children of Israel came and brought a [a]Midianite woman to his brothers in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.',
'25:7': 'And when [a]Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the assembly and took a spear in his hand,',
'25:8': 'And he went after the man of Israel into the tent and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman through her stomach. So the plague among the children of Israel was stopped.',
'25:9': 'And those who died by the [1]plague were [a]twenty-four thousand.',
'25:10': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'25:11': 'Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned My wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with My [a]jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the children of Israel in My jealousy.',
'25:12': 'Therefore say, I now give him My [a]covenant of peace;',
'25:13': 'And it shall be to him and to his seed after him the covenant of an [a]everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made expiation for the children of Israel.',
'25:14': 'Now the name of the slain man of Israel, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father&rsquo;s household among the Simeonites.',
'25:15': 'And the name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, head of the people of a father&rsquo;s household in Midian.',
'25:16': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'25:17': 'Harass the [a]Midianites and strike them;',
'25:18': 'For they have harassed you with their deception with which they have deceived you in the matter of Peor and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.',
'26:1': 'Now after the plague Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,',
'26:2': 'Take the [1a]sum of the whole assembly of the children of Israel, from [2]twenty years old and upward, by their [2]fathers&rsquo; households, all who are able to go forth for military service in Israel.',
'26:3': 'So [1]Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,',
'26:4': 'Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward, as Jehovah commanded Moses. Now the children of Israel, who came forth out of the land of Egypt were:',
'26:5': '[a]Reuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;',

'26:58': 'These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites. And [a]Kohath begot Amram.',
'26:59': 'And the name of Amram&rsquo;s wife was [a]Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses and their [b]sister Miriam.',
'26:60': 'And to Aaron were born [a]Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.',
'26:61': 'And [1a]Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before Jehovah.',
'26:62': 'And those who were numbered of them were [a]twenty-three thousand, every male from a month old and upward, for they were [b]not numbered among the children of Israel, because [1c]no inheritance was given to them among the children of Israel.',
'26:63': 'These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.',
'26:64': 'But among these there was [1]not one of those [a]numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who had numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.',
'26:65': 'For Jehovah had said of them, They shall surely die in the [a]wilderness. And not one of them was left, except [b]Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.',
'27:1': 'Then the [1a]daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the [2]families of Manasseh the son of Joseph came near. And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah and Tirzah.',
'27:2': '[a]And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar the priest and before the leaders and the whole assembly at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, saying,',
'27:3': 'Our father died in the [a]wilderness, and he was not among the company of those who gathered themselves together against Jehovah in the company of [b]Korah; but he died in his own sin, and he had no sons.',
'27:4': 'Why should our father&rsquo;s name be taken away from among his family because he had no son? Give us a [1a]possession among our father&rsquo;s brothers.',
'27:5': 'And Moses brought their case before Jehovah.',
'27:6': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'27:7': 'The daughters of Zelophehad speak rightly. You shall surely give them the [1a]possession of an inheritance among their father&rsquo;s brothers; and you shall cause the [b]inheritance of their father to pass to them.',
'27:8': 'And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, [1]If a man dies and has no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter.',
'27:9': 'And if he does not have a daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.',
'27:10': 'And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father&rsquo;s brothers.',
'27:11': 'And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his [a]relative nearest to him among his family, and he shall possess it. And it shall be a statute of judgment for the children of Israel, as Jehovah commanded Moses.',
'27:12': '[a]And Jehovah said to Moses, Go up to this mountain of the Abarim and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.',
'27:13': 'And when you have seen it, you also shall be [a]gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother was [b]gathered,',
'27:14': 'Because you [1a]rebelled against My word in the wilderness of Zin, in the strife of the assembly, and failed to [1]sanctify Me at the waters before their eyes. (These are the waters of [2]Meribah-kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin.)',
'27:15': 'And Moses spoke to Jehovah, saying,',
'27:16': 'Let Jehovah, the [a]God of the [1]spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the assembly,',
'27:17': 'Who will go out before them and who will come in before them, and who will lead them [a]out and who will bring them in; so that the assembly of Jehovah will not be like [b]sheep which have no [1]shepherd.',
'27:18': 'And Jehovah said to Moses, Take [a]Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the [b]Spirit, and [c]lay your hand upon him;',
'27:19': 'And set him before Eleazar the priest and before the whole assembly, and give him a charge in their sight.',
'27:20': 'And you shall put some of your honor upon him, so that the whole assembly of the children of Israel may obey him.',
'27:21': 'And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, and he shall inquire for him by the judgment of the [1a]Urim before Jehovah. At his word shall they go out and at his word they shall come in, both he and all the children of Israel with him, even the whole assembly.',
'27:22': 'And Moses did as Jehovah commanded him, and he took Joshua and set him before Eleazar the priest and before the whole assembly.',
'27:23': 'And he [1]laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge just as Jehovah had spoken through Moses.',
'28:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'28:2': 'Command the children of Israel and say to them, My offering, My [1a]food for My offerings by fire of a [b]satisfying fragrance to Me, you shall be careful to present to Me at its appointed time.',
'28:3': 'And you shall say to them, [a]This is the offering by fire which you shall present to Jehovah: two male lambs a year old without blemish each day as a continual burnt offering.',
'28:4': 'One lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer [1]at twilight;',
'28:5': 'Also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a [1]meal offering, mingled with the fourth of a hin of beaten oil.',
'28:6': 'It is a continual burnt offering, which was set up on Mount Sinai for a satisfying fragrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah.',
'28:7': '[a]And its [1]drink offering shall be the fourth of a hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to Jehovah.',
'28:8': 'And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; you shall offer it with the meal offering and its drink offering as in the morning, an offering by fire, a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah.',
'28:9': 'And on the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish, and two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and its drink offering&mdash;',
'28:10': 'This is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.',
'28:11': 'And at the [1a]beginnings of your months [b]you shall present a burnt offering to Jehovah: two bulls of the herd and one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;',

'28:14': 'And their [a]drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and a third of a hin for the ram, and a fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year.',
'28:15': 'Also one male goat for a [1]sin offering to Jehovah shall be offered in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.',
'28:16': 'And in the [a]first month on the fourteenth day of the month shall be Jehovah&rsquo;s [1b]Passover.',

'30:1': 'And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is what Jehovah has commanded:',
'30:2': 'When a man vows a [1a]vow to Jehovah or [b]swears an oath to bind himself by pledge, he shall [c]not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.',
'30:3': 'But when a [1]woman vows a vow to Jehovah or binds herself by pledge in her [1]father&rsquo;s house in her youth,',
'30:4': 'And her father hears of her vow or her pledge by which she has bound herself, and her father is silent with respect to her; then all her vows will stand, and any pledge by which she has bound herself will stand.',
'30:5': 'But if her father disallows her on the day he hears, none of her vows or of her pledges by which she has bound herself will stand; and Jehovah will forgive her because her father disallowed her.',
'30:6': 'And if she gets married, while her [a]vows are upon her or the rash utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself,',
'30:7': 'And her [1]husband hears of it and is silent with respect to her on the day he hears it, then her vows will stand and her pledges by which she has bound herself will stand.',
'30:8': 'But if, on the day her husband hears of it, he disallows her, then he makes void her vow which is upon her and the rash utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself; and Jehovah will forgive her.',
'30:9': 'But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself, will stand against her.',
'30:10': 'And if she vowed in her husband&rsquo;s house or bound herself by a pledge with an oath,',
'30:11': 'And her husband heard of it and was silent with respect to her and did not disallow her, then all her vows will stand and any pledge by which she has bound herself will stand.',
'30:12': 'But if her husband made them null and void on the day he heard of it, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the pledging of herself will not stand; her husband has made them void, and Jehovah will forgive her.',
'30:13': 'As for every vow and every binding oath to afflict herself, her husband may establish it or her husband may make it void.',
'30:14': 'But if her husband is completely silent with respect to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows or all her pledges which are upon her; he has established them because he was silent with respect to her on the day he heard it.',
'30:15': 'But if he makes them null and void some time after he has heard of it, then he shall bear her iniquity.',
'30:16': 'These are the statutes which Jehovah commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter while in her youth in her father&rsquo;s house.',
'31:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'31:2': 'Thoroughly avenge the children of Israel on the [1a]Midianites; afterward you will be [b]gathered to your people.',
'31:3': 'And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm men from among you for the war, that they may come upon Midian to execute Jehovah&rsquo;s vengeance on Midian.',
'31:4': 'A thousand from each tribe, of all the tribes of Israel, you shall send to the war.',
'31:5': 'So out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand for each tribe were committed, twelve thousand armed for war.',
'31:6': 'And Moses sent them, a thousand for each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest with them, to the war, with the [a]vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.',
'31:7': 'And they warred against Midian, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses; and they [a]killed every male.',
'31:8': '[a]And they killed the kings of Midian in addition to the others slain among them: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; also [b]Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword.',
'31:9': 'And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and all their cattle and all their livestock and all their goods they plundered.',
'31:10': 'And all their cities in which they had settled and all their encampments, they burned with fire.',
'31:11': 'And they took all the spoil and all the booty, both of man and of beast.',
'31:12': 'And they brought the captives and the [a]booty and the spoil to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the assembly of the children of Israel, to the camp in the plains of Moab, which was beside the Jordan at Jericho.',
'31:13': 'And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the assembly went out to meet them outside the camp.',
'31:14': 'And Moses became angry with the officers of the company, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from [a]service in the war.',
'31:15': 'And Moses said to them, Have you [a]kept all the women alive?',
'31:16': 'It was [a]these who caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of [b]Balaam, to act unfaithfully against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, so that the [c]plague came upon the assembly of Jehovah.',
'31:17': 'Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man by lying with him.',
'31:18': 'But all the little ones among the women, who have not known a male by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.',
'31:19': 'And you, encamp outside the camp seven days, everyone who has killed any person and everyone who has touched any slain; [1a]purify yourselves on the [2]third day and on the [2]seventh day, you and your captives.',
'31:20': 'And you shall purify for yourselves every garment and every article of skin and everything made of goats&rsquo; hair and every article of wood.',
'31:21': 'And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah has commanded Moses:',
'31:22': 'Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,',
'31:23': 'Everything that can go into the fire, you shall pass through the [a]fire, and it will become clean; but it shall be purified with the [b]water for impurity; and everything that cannot go into the fire you shall pass through the water.',
'31:24': 'And you shall [a]wash your [1]clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean; and afterward you may come into the camp.',
'31:25': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'31:26': 'You and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers&rsquo; households of the assembly, take the sum of the booty that was captured, both of man and of beast,',
'31:27': 'And [a]halve the booty between those skilled in war who went out to battle and the whole assembly.',
'31:28': 'And levy a tribute to Jehovah from the men of war who went out to battle: [a]one living thing out of five hundred, of the persons and of the cattle and of the donkeys and of the flock;',
'31:29': 'Take it from their half and give it to [1]Eleazar the priest, for [a]Jehovah&rsquo;s heave offering.',
'31:30': 'And of the children of Israel&rsquo;s half, you shall take one seized out of fifty, of the persons, of the cattle, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, from all the beasts, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.',
'31:31': 'And Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Jehovah [1]commanded Moses.',
'31:32': 'Now the booty that was left from the spoil, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,',
'31:33': 'And seventy-two thousand cattle,',
'31:34': 'And sixty-one thousand donkeys,',
'31:35': 'And thirty-two thousand persons in all, the women who had not known lying with a male.',
'31:36': 'And the half which was the portion of those who went out to war was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep.',
'31:37': 'And Jehovah&rsquo;s tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.',
'31:38': 'And the cattle were thirty-six thousand, of which Jehovah&rsquo;s tribute was seventy-two.',
'31:39': 'And the donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred, of which Jehovah&rsquo;s tribute was sixty-one.',
'31:40': 'And the human beings were sixteen thousand, of whom Jehovah&rsquo;s tribute was thirty-two persons.',
'31:41': 'And Moses gave the tribute, Jehovah&rsquo;s heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'31:42': 'And of the children of Israel&rsquo;s half, which Moses had separated from the men who had gone to war,',
'31:43': 'That is, the assembly&rsquo;s half, was three hundred thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,',
'31:44': 'And thirty-six thousand cattle,',
'31:45': 'And thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,',
'31:46': 'And sixteen thousand persons&mdash;',
'31:47': 'Now Moses took from the children of Israel&rsquo;s half, one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'31:48': 'And the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, approached Moses.',
'31:49': 'And they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge, and not a man is missing from us;',
'31:50': 'And we have presented Jehovah&rsquo;s offering, what every man has obtained, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings and pendants, to make [1]expiation for our souls before Jehovah.',
'31:51': 'And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all kinds of wrought articles.',
'31:52': 'And all the gold of the heave offering which they offered up to Jehovah, from the captains of thousands and from the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.',
'31:53': 'The men of war had taken booty, each for himself.',
'31:54': 'So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting as a [a]memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.',
'32:1': '[1]Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great abundance of livestock. And when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that the place was indeed a place for livestock,',
'32:2': 'The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the assembly, saying,',
'32:3': 'Ataroth and Dibon and Jazer and Nimrah and Heshbon and Elealeh and Sebam and Nebo and Beon,',
'32:4': 'The [a]land which Jehovah struck before the assembly of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.',
'32:5': 'And they said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this [1]land be given to your servants for a possession; do not make us [2]cross over the Jordan.',
'32:6': 'And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, while you stay here?',
'32:7': 'Now why would you discourage the heart of the children of Israel from crossing over into the land which Jehovah has given them?',
'32:8': '[a]Your fathers did this when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.',
'32:9': 'When they went up to the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel from going into the land which Jehovah had given them.',
'32:10': '[a]And Jehovah&rsquo;s anger was kindled in that day, and He swore, saying,',
'32:11': 'Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not fully followed Me;',
'32:12': 'Except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, because they have [a]fully followed Jehovah.',
'32:13': 'And Jehovah&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness [a]forty years, until the whole generation which had done evil in the sight of Jehovah was consumed.',
'32:14': 'And now you have risen up in your fathers&rsquo; place, a brood of sinful men, to further increase the burning anger of Jehovah toward Israel.',
'32:15': 'For if you turn away from following Him, He will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy this entire people.',
'32:16': 'And they came near to him and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones;',
'32:17': 'But we ourselves will be [a]armed and ready to go before the children of Israel until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.',
'32:18': 'We will not return to our houses until each one of the children of Israel has inherited his inheritance.',
'32:19': 'For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and further on, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan [a]eastward.',
'32:20': 'And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves before Jehovah for battle,',
'32:21': 'And all of your armed men will cross over the Jordan before Jehovah until He has [a]driven out His enemies from before Him,',
'32:22': 'And the land is subdued before Jehovah, then afterward you shall return and be free of [1]obligation toward Jehovah and toward Israel; and this land shall be yours for a possession before Jehovah.',
'32:23': 'But if you will not do so, then you have sinned against Jehovah; and know that your [a]sin will find you out.',
'32:24': 'Build for yourselves cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what has proceeded out of your mouth.',
'32:25': 'And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.',
'32:26': 'Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle will be there in the cities of Gilead;',
'32:27': 'But your servants will cross over, everyone who is armed for war before Jehovah for battle, as my lord says.',
'32:28': 'So Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the tribes of the children of Israel.',
'32:29': 'And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, everyone who is armed for battle before Jehovah, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as a possession.',
'32:30': 'But if they do not cross over armed with you, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.',
'32:31': 'And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As Jehovah has said to your servants, so will we do.',
'32:32': 'We will cross over armed before Jehovah into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance will remain with us beyond the Jordan.',
'32:33': 'And Moses gave to them, to the children of Gad and to the children of [a]Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of Bashan, the land according to its cities with their territories, the cities of the surrounding land.',

'35:2': 'Command the children of Israel to give to the [a]Levites some of the inheritance of their possession, cities to dwell in; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around their cities.',
'35:3': 'And the cities shall be for them to dwell in, and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their livestock and for all their animals.',
'35:4': 'And the pasture lands of the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be from the city wall and outward, a thousand [a]cubits all around.',
'35:5': 'And you shall measure from the outside of the city on the east side two thousand cubits and on the south side two thousand cubits and on the west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand cubits, with the city in the center. This shall be their pasture lands for the cities.',
'35:6': 'And the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be the six [1a]cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to; and besides them you shall give forty-two cities.',
'35:7': 'All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be [1a]forty-eight cities, they and their pasture lands.',
'35:8': 'And concerning the [1]cities which you shall give from the possession of the children of Israel, from the larger tribe you shall take a [a]larger number, and from the smaller tribe you shall take a smaller number; each one, according to its inheritance which they will inherit, shall give some of its cities to the Levites.',
'35:9': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'35:10': 'Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,',
'35:11': 'Then you shall designate for yourselves cities to be your [a]cities of refuge, so that the manslayer who kills any person unintentionally may flee there.',
'35:12': 'And the cities shall be for you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the manslayer may not die unless he stands before the assembly for judgment.',
'35:13': 'And the cities which you shall give shall be your six cities of refuge.',
'35:14': 'You shall give [a]three cities across the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan; they shall be cities of refuge.',
'35:15': 'For the children of Israel and for the [1]stranger and for the [1]sojourner among them, these six cities shall be for refuge, so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may flee there.',
'35:16': 'But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, and he died, he is a murderer; the [1]murderer shall surely be [a]put to death.',
'35:17': 'And if he struck him with a stone in hand, by which one could die, and he did die, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.',
'35:18': 'Or if he struck him with a wooden object in hand, by which one could die, and he did die, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.',
'35:19': 'The [a]avenger of blood himself shall put the murderer to death; when he encounters him, he shall put him to death.',
'35:20': 'And if he pushed him out of hatred or threw something upon him while lying in wait, and he died,',
'35:21': 'Or in enmity struck him with his hand, and he died, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer. The avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he encounters him.',
'35:22': 'But if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or threw upon him anything without lying in wait,',
'35:23': 'Or came upon him with any stone, by which someone could die, without seeing him and dropped it upon him, and he died, when he was not his enemy and did not seek his harm,',
'35:24': 'Then the assembly shall [a]judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these ordinances.',
'35:25': 'And the assembly shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the assembly shall return him to his city of refuge to which he had fled; and he shall dwell in it until the death of the [1]high priest, who was [a]anointed with the holy oil.',
'35:26': 'But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the boundary of his city of refuge to which he has fled,',
'35:27': 'And the avenger of blood finds him outside the boundary of his city of refuge and the avenger of blood slays the manslayer, he shall not have guilt for blood,',
'35:28': 'Because he should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return to the land of his possession.',
'35:29': 'And these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.',
'35:30': 'Whoever kills a person, the murderer shall be slain upon the testimony of [a]witnesses; but one witness shall not testify against any person so that he die.',
'35:31': 'Moreover you shall not take a ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.',
'35:32': 'And you shall not take a ransom for one who has fled to his city of refuge, so that he may return to live in the land before the death of the high priest.',
'35:33': 'Thus you shall not pollute the land in which you are, for blood [a]pollutes the land. And no expiation can be made for the land for the blood that is shed in it, except by the [b]blood of the one who shed it.',
'35:34': 'And you shall not defile the land in which you are dwelling, in the midst of which I [a]tabernacle; for I Jehovah tabernacle in the [b]midst of the children of Israel.',
'36:1': 'And the heads of the fathers&rsquo; households of the family of the sons of [a]Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers&rsquo; households of the children of Israel;',
'36:2': 'And they said, Jehovah commanded my lord to give the land for inheritance by [a]lot to the children of Israel, and my lord was commanded by Jehovah to give the inheritance of [b]Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.',
'36:3': 'But if they [1]are married to one of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of our fathers and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so it will be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.',
'36:4': 'And when the [a]jubilee of the children of Israel takes place, then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.',
'36:5': 'Then Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of Jehovah, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks correctly.',
'36:6': 'This is what Jehovah commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be [1]married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father they shall marry.',
'36:7': '[a]So an inheritance of the children of Israel shall not go around from tribe to tribe, for each one of the children of Israel shall [1]cling to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.',
'36:8': 'And every [a]daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel shall [1]marry into one of the family of the tribe of her father, so that each one of the children of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers.',
'36:9': '[a]So an inheritance shall not go around from one tribe to another tribe, for each one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall cling to his own inheritance.',
'36:10': 'Just as Jehovah had commanded Moses, so the daughters of Zelophehad did;',
'36:11': 'That is, Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah and Noah, the daughters of [a]Zelophehad, were married to their uncles&rsquo; sons.',
'36:12': 'They married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.',
'36:13': 'These are the commandments and the ordinances which Jehovah commanded through Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the [1]Jordan at Jericho.',

All Scripture reveals Christ and is a record concerning Christ, either directly or indirectly ({Luk24:27|Luke 24:27}, {Luk24:44|44}). The cities of refuge in {Num35|ch. 35} are a type of Christ, and the settlement of the problem regarding the inheritance in {Num36|ch. 36} is related to Christ. If Christ had not been incarnated, He could not have become the cities of refuge for the human race.

{sup:1, word:"Jordan", lines:["The books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers portray in typology God&rsquo;s need for a people to be saved and to go on with Him to enjoy His Christ, to receive His revelation, and to be built up with Him as the processed Triune God, that they may be formed into a priestly army to journey with Him and to fight with Him. These books also show that God&rsquo;s people need to be disciplined by passing through certain difficulties and undergoing different kinds of frustrations. In {Exo12|Exo. 12}&mdash;{Exo14|14} Israel as God&rsquo;s people was redeemed from God&rsquo;s judgment by the passover and saved from Egypt by the saving power of the Triune God. Then, they enjoyed the heavenly provision and the divine care in their initial journey in the wilderness ({Exo15|Exo. 15}&mdash;{Exo17|17}). In {Exo19|Exo. 19}&mdash;{Exo40|40} and {Lev1|Lev. 1}&mdash;{Lev27|27} they received the divine revelation and training in knowing God, in being built up together with God as His dwelling on earth for His expression and testimony, and in the building up of the priesthood for the divine service. All this took place at the foot of Mount Sinai, where the people were given the law as a portrait of what God is in His attributes. The book of Numbers records how God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people were formed into a priestly army to journey with God and to fight with God for His interest on earth (chs. {Num1|1}&mdash;{Num4|4}; {Num9:15|9:15}&mdash;{Num10:36|10:36}; {Num12:16|12:16}; {Num20:1|20:1}&mdash;{Num21:35|21:35}; {Num31:1|31:1}-{Num31:54|54}; {Num33:1|33:1}-{Num33:49|49}). In Numbers the children of Israel also passed through various frustrations, trials, and disciplinings for their purification. Eventually, in {Num32|ch. 32} and in {Num33:50|33:50}&mdash;{Num36:13|36:13} God&rsquo;s people received the prearrangement for the distribution of the promised good land. After all the foregoing, God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people were ready to cross the Jordan, enter Canaan, consume its inhabitants, and possess the good land promised by the faithful God ({Jos1:2|Josh. 1:2}-{Jos1:3|3}). With the exception of Joshua and Caleb, those who were qualified to take possession of the land were the younger ones, the second generation of those who had come out of Egypt. This younger generation had received the benefit of all that the first generation had experienced. With a rich inheritance and strong background, they were qualified to be formed into an army to fight with God and for God for the accomplishing of His economy. This history of Israel is a full type of the history of the church in its accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy in the mystical union with the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed and dispensing Triune God ({1Co5:6|1&nbsp;Cor. 5:6}-{1Co5:8|8}; {1Co10:1|10:1}-{1Co10:13|13}; {Heb3:7|Heb. 3:7}&mdash;{Heb4:13|4:13}).
