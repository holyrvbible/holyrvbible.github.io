'1:1': '[1]That which was [2]from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have [a]seen with our [b]eyes, which we [3]beheld and our hands [4c]handled, concerning the [5]Word of [6]life',
'1:2': '(And the [1a]life was [2b]manifested, and we have seen and [c]testify and report to you [3]the [d]eternal life, which was [4e]with the [5]Father and was [6]manifested to us);',
'1:3': 'That which we have [1]seen and heard we report [2]also to you that you [2]also may have [3a]fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the [4]Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.',
'1:4': 'And these things we write that [1]our [2a]joy may be made full.',
'1:5': '[1]And this is the [a]message which we have heard from Him and announce to you, that [2]God is [3b]light and in Him is no [4]darkness at all.',
'1:6': 'If we say that we [1]have fellowship [2]with Him and yet [3]walk in the [a]darkness, we [4b]lie and are not [5]practicing the [6]truth;',
'1:7': 'But if we [a]walk in the light as He [1]is in the light, we [2]have fellowship with one another, and the [3b]blood of [4]Jesus His Son [5]cleanses us from every [6]sin.',
'1:8': 'If we say that we [1]do not have sin, [2]we are deceiving ourselves, and the [3a]truth is not in us.',
'1:9': 'If we [1a]confess our sins, He is [2b]faithful and [c]righteous to [d]forgive us our [e]sins and [3f]cleanse us from all [4g]unrighteousness.',
'1:10': 'If we say that we [1]have [a]not sinned, we make Him a [b]liar, and His [2c]word is not in us.',
'2:1': 'My [1]little children, [2]these things I write to you that you [3]may not sin. And if anyone [4]sins, we have an [5a]Advocate [6]with the [7]Father, Jesus Christ the [8b]Righteous;',
'2:2': 'And He Himself is the [1a]propitiation for our [b]sins, and not for ours only but also for <I>those</I> <I>of</I> the [2]whole [c]world.',
'2:3': '[1]And in this we [2]know that we [3a]know Him, if we [b]keep His [4]commandments.',
'2:4': 'He who says, I know Him, and does not keep His commandments is a [1a]liar, and the [2b]truth is not in this one;',
'2:5': 'But whoever [a]keeps His [1b]word, truly in this one the [2c]love of God has been [3d]perfected. In this we know that we are [4e]in Him.',
'2:6': 'He who says he [1a]abides in Him ought himself also to [b]walk even [c]as [2d]He walked.',
'2:7': 'Beloved, I am not writing a [a]new commandment to you but an [1]old commandment, which you have had [2]from the beginning; the old commandment is the word which you [b]heard.',
'2:8': 'Yet again a [1]new commandment I am writing to you, [2]which is true in Him and in you because the [3a]darkness is passing away and the true [b]light is already shining.',
'2:9': 'He who says he is [a]in the [1]light and yet [b]hates his brother is in the darkness until now.',
'2:10': 'He who [a]loves his brother [1b]abides in the [2]light, and there is no cause of [c]stumbling in him;',
'2:11': 'But he who [1a]hates his brother is in the [b]darkness and walks in the darkness and does not know where he is [2]going, because the darkness has [3c]blinded his eyes.',
'2:12': 'I write to you, [1]little children, because your sins have been [2a]forgiven you because of His [b]name.',
'2:13': 'I write to you, [1]fathers, because you [2a]know [3]Him who is [4]from the beginning. I write to you, [5]young men, because you have [6b]overcome the [7c]evil one. I [8]write to you, [9]young children, because you [d]know the [10]Father.',
'2:14': 'I have [1]written to you, fathers, because you know Him who is from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because [2]you are [a]strong and the word of God [b]abides in you and you have overcome the [3]evil one.',
'2:15': '[1]Do not love the [2a]world nor the things in the world. If anyone [b]loves the [c]world, [3d]love for the [4]Father is not in him;',
'2:16': 'Because all that is in the world, the [1a]lust of the flesh and the [1]lust of the [b]eyes and the [1]vainglory of [2c]life, is not of the Father but is of the world.',
'2:17': 'And the world is [a]passing away, and its [1]lust, but he who [2b]does the [1c]will of God abides forever.',
'2:18': '[1]Young children, it is the [a]last hour; and even as you heard that [2b]antichrist is coming, even now [3]many antichrists have [c]come; whereby we know that it is the last hour.',
'2:19': 'They [a]went out from us, but they were [1]not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have [2]remained with us; but <I>they</I> <I>went</I> <I>out</I> that they might be [b]manifested that they all are not of us.',
'2:20': 'And you have an [1a]anointing from the [b]Holy One, and [2c]all of you [d]know.',
'2:21': 'I have not written to you because you do not know the [1]truth, but because you [2]know it and because no [a]lie is of the [1]truth.',
'2:22': 'Who is the [a]liar if not he who [1b]denies that [2c]Jesus is the Christ? This is the [d]antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son.',
'2:23': 'Everyone who [1]denies the Son does not have the [a]Father either; he who confesses the [b]Son has the Father also.',
'2:24': 'As for you, [1]that which you heard [2]from the beginning, let it abide in you. If that which you [a]heard [2]from the beginning [b]abides in you, you also will [3c]abide in the [d]Son and in the Father.',
'2:25': 'And this is the promise which [1]He Himself [2]promised us, the [3a]eternal life.',
'2:26': 'These things I have written to you [1]concerning those who [2a]lead you astray.',
'2:27': 'And as for you, the [1]anointing which you have received from [2]Him [3]abides in you, and you have [4]no need that anyone teach you; but as [2]His anointing [5a]teaches you concerning [6]all things and is [7]true and is not a [b]lie, and even as it has taught you, [8]abide in [2]Him.',
'2:28': 'And now, [1]little children, [2]abide in Him, so that if [3]He is [a]manifested, we may have [b]boldness and not be [4]put to [c]shame [5]from Him [6]at His [d]coming.',
'2:29': 'If you [1]know that [2]He is [3a]righteous, [4]you [5]know that everyone who [6b]practices [c]righteousness also has been [7]begotten of Him.',
'3:1': '[1]Behold what manner of [2a]love the [3]Father has given to us, that we should be called [4b]children of God; and we are. [5]Because of this the world does not [6]know us, [7]because it did not [c]know Him.',
'3:2': 'Beloved, now we are children of God, and [1]it has not yet been manifested what we will be. We [2]know that if [3]He is [a]manifested, we will be [b]like Him because we will [4c]see Him even as [3]He is.',
'3:3': 'And everyone who has [1]this [a]hope <I>set</I> on Him [2b]purifies himself, even as [3c]He is pure.',
'3:4': 'Everyone who [1a]practices sin practices [2]lawlessness also, and [b]sin is lawlessness.',

'3:8': 'He who [1a]practices sin is of the [2b]devil, because the devil has [1]sinned [3]from the beginning. [4]For this purpose the Son of God was [c]manifested, that He might [5d]destroy the works of the devil.',
'3:9': 'Everyone who has been [1]begotten of God does [2]not practice sin, because His [3a]seed [b]abides in him; and he [4]cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.',

'4:18': 'There is no [1a]fear in love, but [2]perfect love casts out fear because fear has punishment, and he who fears has [3]not been perfected in love.',
'4:19': 'We love because He [1]first [a]loved us.',

'5:7': 'For there are three who testify,',
'5:8': 'The Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are [1]unto the one thing.',
'5:9': 'If we receive the [a]testimony of men, the [1b]testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His [c]Son.',

'5:17': 'All [1a]unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.',
'5:18': 'We know that everyone who is [1]begotten of God [a]does not sin, but [2]he who has been begotten of God [3b]keeps himself, and the [4]evil one does not [5]touch him.',

Paul&rsquo;s writings were completed around A.D. 67. Paul&rsquo;s completing ministry was damaged by the apostasy preceding and following his death. Then after a quarter of a century, around A.D. 90, John&rsquo;s writings came forth. John&rsquo;s ministry was not only to mend the broken ministry of Paul but also to consummate the entire divine revelation of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, of both the Gospels and the Epistles. In such a ministry, the focus is the mysteries of the divine life. John&rsquo;s Gospel, as the consummation of the Gospels, unveils the mysteries of the person and work of the Lord Jesus Christ. John&rsquo;s Epistles (especially the first), as the consummation of the Epistles, unfold the mystery of the fellowship of the divine life, which is the fellowship of God&rsquo;s children with God the Father and with one another. Then John&rsquo;s Revelation, as the consummation of the New Testament and the Old Testament, reveals the mystery of Christ as the life supply to God&rsquo;s children for His expression and as the center of the universal administration of the Triune God. Here John used the expression that which to open his Epistle and unfold the mystery of the fellowship in the divine life. That he did not use personal pronouns in reference to the Lord implies that what he was about to unfold is mysterious."]},

In his Gospel, John revealed the way for sinners to receive the eternal life&mdash;to believe in the Son of God. In his Epistle he pointed out the way for the believers, who have received the divine life, to enjoy that life in its fellowship&mdash;to abide in the Son of God. And in his Revelation he unveiled the consummation of the eternal life as the believers&rsquo; full enjoyment in eternity.","The phrase from the beginning is used four times in the Gospel of John, eight times in this Epistle, and twice in 2&nbsp;John.

Both love and light are related to God as life, which is of the Spirit ({Rom8:2|Rom. 8:2}). God, Spirit, and life are actually one. God is Spirit and Spirit is life. Within this life are love and light. When the divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when the divine light shines on us, it becomes truth.

John&rsquo;s Epistle is the continuation of his Gospel. In John&rsquo;s Gospel it is God in the Son coming to us as grace and truth that we may become His children ({Joh1:12|John 1:12}-{Joh1:13|13}); in John&rsquo;s Epistle it is we, the children, in the fellowship of the Father&rsquo;s life, going to the Father to participate in His love and light (see {1Jo4:8^2|note 8<sup>2</sup>} in {1Jo4|ch. 4}). The former was God&rsquo;s coming out to the outer court to meet our need at the altar ({Lev4:28|Lev. 4:28}-{Lev4:31|31}); the latter is our entering into the Holy of Holies to contact Him at the Ark ({Exo25:22|Exo. 25:22}).

After receiving the divine life by believing into the Son in John&rsquo;s Gospel, we should go on to enjoy this life through the fellowship of this life in John&rsquo;s Epistle.

Its denotation in each occurrence is determined by its context. For instance, in {Joh3:21|John 3:21}, according to the context, it denotes uprightness (the opposite of evil&mdash;{Joh3:19|John 3:19}-{Joh3:20|20}), which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is and which corresponds with the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ. In {Joh4:23|John 4:23}-{Joh4:24|24}, according to the context of that chapter and also according to the entire revelation of John&rsquo;s Gospel, it denotes the divine reality becoming man&rsquo;s genuineness and sincerity (the opposite of the hypocrisy of the immoral Samaritan worshipper&mdash;{Joh4:16|John 4:16}-{Joh4:18|18}) for the true worship of God. The divine reality is Christ, who is the reality ({Joh14:6|John 14:6}), as the reality of all the offerings of the Old Testament for the worship of God ({Joh1:29|John 1:29}; {Joh3:14|3:14}) and as the fountain of living water, the life-giving Spirit ({Joh4:7|John 4:7}-{Joh4:15|15}), partaken of and drunk by His believers to be the reality within them, which eventually becomes their genuineness and sincerity, in which they worship God with the worship that He seeks. In {Joh5:33|John 5:33} and {Joh18:37|18:37}, according to the entire revelation of the Gospel of John, truth denotes the divine reality embodied, revealed, and expressed in Christ as the Son of God. In {Joh8:32|John 8:32}, {Joh8:40|40}, {Joh8:44|44}-{Joh8:46|46}, according to the context of that chapter, it denotes the reality of God revealed in His word ({Joh8:47|John 8:47}) and embodied in Christ, the Son of God ({Joh8:36|John 8:36}), which sets us free from the bondage of sin (see {Joh8:32^1|note 32<sup>1</sup>} in {Joh8|John 8}).","Here in {1Jo1:6|v. 6}, truth denotes the revealed reality of God in its aspect of the divine light. It is the issue and realization of the divine light mentioned in {1Jo1:5|v. 5}. The divine light is the source in God; truth is the issue and realization of the divine light in us (see {1Jo4:8^2|note 8<sup>2</sup>} in {1Jo4|ch. 4}; cf. {Joh3:19|John 3:19}-{Joh3:21|21}). When we abide in the divine light, which we enjoy in the fellowship of the divine life, we practice the truth&mdash;what we have realized in the divine light. When we abide in the source, its issue becomes our practice."]},

Sin refers to the indwelling sin, which came through Adam into mankind from Satan ({Rom5:12|Rom. 5:12}). It is dealt with in the second section of Romans, {Rom5:12|5:12}&mdash;{Rom8:13|8:13} (with the exception of {Rom7:5|7:5}, where sins is mentioned). Sins refers to the sinful deeds, the fruits of the indwelling sin, which are dealt with in the first section of Romans, {Rom1:18|1:18}&mdash;{Rom5:11|5:11}. However, in this verse sin in the singular, used with the adjective every, does not denote the indwelling sin but every single sin we commit ({1Jo1:10|v. 10}) after we are regenerated; each such sin defiles our purged conscience and needs to be cleansed away by the blood of the Lord in our fellowship with God.","Our sin, the indwelling sin in our nature ({Rom7:17|Rom. 7:17}), has been dealt with by Christ as our sin offering ({Lev4|Lev. 4}; {Isa53:10|Isa. 53:10}; {Rom8:3|Rom. 8:3}; {2Co5:21|2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21}; {Heb9:26|Heb. 9:26}).

Such sinning interrupts their fellowship with God. If after regeneration the believers do not have sin in their nature, how could they sin in their conduct? Even if they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is adequate proof that they still have sin working within them. Otherwise, there would be no interruption in their fellowship with God. The apostle&rsquo;s teaching here also condemns today&rsquo;s teaching of perfectionism, which says that a state of freedom from sin is attainable or has been attained in this earthly life; and it annuls today&rsquo;s erroneous teaching of the eradication of the sinful nature, which, misinterpreting the word in {1Jo3:9|3:9} and {1Jo5:18|5:18}, says that regenerated persons cannot sin because their sinful nature has been totally eradicated."]},

Since this section, vv. {1Jo5:14|14}-{1Jo5:17|17}, is related to prayer in the fellowship of eternal life (covered in {1Jo1:3|1:3}&mdash;{1Jo2:11|2:11}), whatever it deals with must be related to the matter of the fellowship of the divine life. In the fellowship of the divine life there is the governmental dealing of God according to the spiritual condition of each of His children. In God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, some of His children may be destined to physical death in this age because of a certain sin, and others may be destined to physical death because of other sins. The situation is like that of Ananias and his wife, Sapphira, who were dealt with by physical death because they lied to the Holy Spirit ({Act5:1|Acts 5:1}-{Act5:11|11}), and like that of the Corinthian believers, who were dealt with by the same judgment because they did not discern the Body ({1Co11:29|1&nbsp;Cor. 11:29}-{1Co11:30|30}). This was typified by God&rsquo;s dealing with the children of Israel in the wilderness ({1Co10:5|1&nbsp;Cor. 10:5}-{1Co10:11|11}). All the Israelites except Caleb and Joshua were judged by God with physical death because of certain sins. God&rsquo;s governmental dealing is severe. Miriam, Aaron, and even Moses were not spared from this kind of dealing, which came because of certain of their failures ({Num12:1|Num. 12:1}-{Num12:15|15}; {Num20:1|20:1}, {Num20:12|12}, {Num20:22|22}-{Num20:29|29}; {Deu1:37|Deut. 1:37}; {Deu3:26|3:26}-{Deu3:27|27}; {Deu32:48|32:48}-{Deu32:52|52}). The punishment of God&rsquo;s governmental dealing with His children is not at all related to eternal perdition; it is a dispensational dealing according to the divine government, a dealing that is related to our fellowship with God and with one another. Whether or not a sin is unto death depends on God&rsquo;s judgment according to the sinning believer&rsquo;s position and condition in the house of God. In any case, for the children of God to sin is a serious matter. It may be judged by God with physical death in this age! The apostle did not say that we should make request concerning a sin that is unto death."]},

The idols here also refer to anything that replaces the real God. As genuine children of the genuine God, we should be on the alert to guard ourselves from these heretical substitutes and from all vain replacements for our genuine and real God, with whom we are organically one and who is eternal life to us. This is the aged apostle&rsquo;s word of warning to all his little children as a conclusion to his Epistle.","The center of this Epistle&rsquo;s revelation is the divine fellowship of the divine life, the fellowship between the children of God and their Father God, who is not only the source of the divine life but is also light and love as the source of the enjoyment of the divine life ({1Jo1:1|1:1}-{1Jo1:7|7}; {1Jo4:8|4:8}, {1Jo4:16|16}). To enjoy the divine life we need to abide in its fellowship according to the divine anointing ({1Jo2:12|2:12}-{1Jo2:28|28}; {1Jo3:24|3:24}), based on the divine birth with the divine seed for the development of the divine birth ({1Jo2:29|2:29}&mdash;{1Jo3:10|3:10}). This divine birth was carried out by three means: the terminating water, the redeeming blood, and the germinating Spirit (vv. {1Jo5:1|1}-{1Jo5:13|13}). By these we have been born of God to be His children, possessing His divine life and partaking of His divine nature ({1Jo2:29|2:29}&mdash;{1Jo3:1|3:1}). He is now indwelling us through His Spirit ({1Jo3:24|3:24}; {1Jo4:4|4:4}, {1Jo4:13|13}) to be our life and life supply that we may grow with His divine element unto His likeness at His manifestation ({1Jo3:1|3:1}-{1Jo3:2|2}). To abide in the divine fellowship of the divine life, that is, to abide in the Lord ({1Jo2:6|2:6}; {1Jo3:6|3:6}), is to enjoy all His divine riches. By such abiding we walk in the divine light ({1Jo1:5|1:5}-{1Jo1:7|7}) and practice the truth, righteousness, love, the will of God, and the commandments of God ({1Jo1:6|1:6}; {1Jo2:29|2:29}, {1Jo2:5|5}; {1Jo3:10|3:10}-{1Jo3:11|11}; {1Jo2:17|2:17}; {1Jo5:2|5:2}) by the divine life received through the divine birth ({1Jo2:29|2:29}; {1Jo4:7|4:7}). To preserve ourselves in this abiding in the divine fellowship, three main negative things need to be dealt with. The first is sin, which is lawlessness and unrighteousness ({1Jo1:7|1:7}&mdash;{1Jo2:6|2:6}; {1Jo3:4|3:4}-{1Jo3:10|10}; {1Jo5:16|5:16}-{1Jo5:18|18}); the second is the world, which is composed of the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of this life ({1Jo2:15|2:15}-{1Jo2:17|17}; {1Jo4:3|4:3}-{1Jo4:5|5}; {1Jo5:4|5:4}-{1Jo5:5|5}, {1Jo5:19|19}); and the last is idols, which are the heretical substitutes for the genuine God and the vain replacements for the real God ({1Jo5:21|v. 21}). These three categories of exceedingly evil things are weapons used by the evil one, the devil, to frustrate, harm, and, if possible, even annihilate our abiding in the divine fellowship. The safeguard against his evildoings is our divine birth with the divine life ({1Jo5:18|v. 18}); and, based on the fact that through His death on the cross the Son of God destroyed the works of the devil ({1Jo3:8|3:8}), we overcome him by the word of God that abides in us ({1Jo2:14|2:14}). By virtue of our divine birth we also overcome his evil world by our faith in the Son of God (vv. {1Jo5:4|4}-{1Jo5:5|5}). Moreover, our divine birth with the divine seed that was sown into our inner being enables us not to live habitually in sin ({1Jo3:9|3:9}; {1Jo5:18|5:18}), because Christ has taken away sins through His death in the flesh ({1Jo3:5|3:5}). In case we sin occasionally, we have our Advocate as our propitiatory sacrifice to take care of our case before our Father God ({1Jo2:1|2:1}-{1Jo2:2|2}), and His everlasting efficacious blood cleanses us ({1Jo1:7|1:7}). Such a revelation is the basic and substantial element of the apostle&rsquo;s mending ministry."]},
