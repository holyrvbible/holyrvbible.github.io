'1:4': 'For giving prudence to the simple,<br>Knowledge and discretion to the young man;',
'1:5': 'That the wise man may hear and increase in learning,<br>And he who has understanding may acquire sound counsel;',

'1:7': 'The [1a]fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge;<br>Fools despise wisdom and instruction.',
'1:8': 'Hear, my son, the instruction of your [1a]father,<br>And do not reject the teaching of your [1]mother;',
'1:9': 'For they will be a wreath of grace for your head<br>And ornaments for your neck.',
'1:10': 'My son, if sinners entice you,<br>Do not consent.',
'1:11': 'If they say, Come with us; let us lie in wait for blood;<br>Let us ambush the innocent without cause;',
'1:12': 'Let us swallow them alive like [1]Sheol,<br>And whole, like those who go down into the pit.',
'1:13': 'We will find all manner of precious goods;<br>We will fill our houses with booty;',
'1:14': 'Throw in your lot with us;<br>We will all have one purse&mdash;',
'1:15': 'My son, do not walk with them on this way;<br>Keep your foot from their path.',
'1:16': 'For their [a]feet run toward evil,<br>And they hasten to shed blood.',
'1:17': 'For in vain is the net spread<br>In the eyes of any bird;',
'1:18': 'Yet they lie in wait for their own blood;<br>They ambush their own lives!',
'1:19': 'Such are the ways of everyone greedy for gain;<br>It takes away the life of its owners.',
'1:20': '[1]Wisdom [a]cries out in the street;<br>[2]She utters her voice in the open squares.',
'1:21': 'At the head of the tumultuous street she cries;<br>At the entrance of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:',
'1:22': 'How long, O simple ones, will you love simpleness,<br>And will scoffers delight themselves in scoffing,<br>And will fools hate knowledge?',
'1:23': 'Turn yourselves at my reproof&mdash;<br>Immediately I will [a]pour out my spirit on you;<br>I will make my words known to you.',
'1:24': 'Because I [a]called and you refused;<br>I stretched out my hand and no one heeded,',
'1:25': 'And you neglected all my counsel<br>And would have none of my reproof;',
'1:26': 'I also will laugh at your calamity;<br>I will mock when what you dread comes,',
'1:27': 'When what you dread comes like a storm,<br>And your calamity comes like a whirlwind,<br>When distress and anguish come upon you.',
'1:28': 'Then they will call on me, but I will not answer;<br>They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.',
'1:29': 'Because they hated knowledge<br>And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,',
'1:30': 'And would have none of my counsel<br>And despised all my reproof;',
'1:31': 'They shall eat of the fruit of their own way<br>And be filled with their own devices.',
'1:32': 'For the turning away of the simple will kill them,<br>And the prosperity of the foolish will cause them to perish;',

'2:1': '[a]My son, if you receive my words<br>And treasure up my commandments within you,',
'2:2': 'Making your ear attentive to wisdom<br>And inclining your heart to understanding;',

'3:16': 'Length of days is in her right hand;<br>In her left hand are riches and honor.',
'3:17': 'Her ways are ways of pleasantness,<br>And all her paths are peace.',
'3:18': 'She is a [a]tree of life to those who lay hold of her,<br>And happy are those who hold her fast.',
'3:19': 'Jehovah by [1]wisdom founded the [a]earth;<br>He established the heavens by understanding;',
'3:20': 'By His knowledge the [a]depths were broken open<br>And the skies drop down the [b]dew.',
'3:21': 'My son, do not let these depart from your sight:<br>Keep sound wisdom and discretion;',
'3:22': 'And they will be life for your soul<br>And a graceful ornament for your neck.',
'3:23': 'Then you will walk on your way securely,<br>And your foot will not stumble.',
'3:24': 'When you lie down, you will not be afraid;<br>But you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.',
'3:25': 'Do not [a]be afraid of sudden fear,<br>Nor of the destruction of the wicked when it comes;',

'3:30': 'Do not strive with a man without cause,<br>If he has done you no harm.',
'3:31': 'Do not envy a man of violence,<br>And do not choose any of his ways;',

'4:1': '[a]Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father,<br>And be attentive, that you may gain understanding;',

'4:3': 'For I was a son to my father,<br>[a]Tender and the only beloved in the sight of my mother.',
'4:4': 'And he taught me and said to me,<br>Let your heart hold fast to my words;<br>Keep my commandments and live;',
'4:5': 'Get [a]wisdom; get understanding;<br>Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.',
'4:6': 'Do not forsake her, and she will keep you;<br>Love her, and she will guard you.',
'4:7': 'The beginning of wisdom is this:<br>Get wisdom; and in all your getting, get understanding.',
'4:8': 'Prize her highly, and she will exalt you;<br>She will honor you if you embrace her.',
'4:9': 'She will give a garland of grace for your head;<br>A crown of beauty will she bestow on you.',

'4:11': 'I have taught you in the way of wisdom;<br>I have led you in the paths of uprightness.',
'4:12': 'When you walk, your steps will not be hindered;<br>And when you run, you will not stumble.',
'4:13': 'Take hold of instruction; do not let go;<br>Guard her, for she is your life.',
'4:14': 'Do not enter the path of the wicked,<br>And do not walk in the way of the evil.',
'4:15': 'Avoid it; do not pass by it;<br>Turn away from it and pass on by.',
'4:16': 'For they cannot sleep unless they do evil;<br>And they are robbed of their sleep unless they cause someone to stumble.',
'4:17': 'For they eat the bread of wickedness<br>And drink the wine of violence.',
'4:18': 'But the path of the righteous is like the [a]light of [1]dawn,<br>Which shines brighter and brighter until the full day.',
'4:19': 'The way of the wicked is like deep darkness;<br>They do not know what they [a]stumble over.',
'4:20': '[a]My son, be attentive to my words;<br>Incline your ear to my sayings.',
'4:21': 'Do not let them depart from your sight;<br>Keep them in the midst of your heart.',
'4:22': 'For they are life to those who find them,<br>And [a]healing to all their flesh.',
'4:23': '[a]Keep your heart with all vigilance,<br>For [b]from it are the issues of life.',
'4:24': 'Put away from you crooked speech,<br>And put perverse talk far from you.',
'4:25': 'Let your eyes look directly ahead,<br>And let your gaze be straight in front of you.',
'4:26': 'Make straight the path of your feet,<br>And all your ways will be established.',
'4:27': 'Do not turn to the right or to the left;<br>Turn your foot away from evil.',
'5:1': '[a]My son, be attentive to my wisdom;<br>Incline your ear to my understanding,',
'5:2': 'That you may keep discretion,<br>And your lips may guard knowledge.',
'5:3': 'For the lips of a [1]strange woman drip honey,<br>And her mouth is smoother than oil;',
'5:4': 'But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,<br>Sharp as a [a]two-edged sword.',
'5:5': 'Her feet go down to death;<br>Her steps hold fast to Sheol.',
'5:6': 'She does not make straight the path of life:<br>Her ways wander, and she does not know it.',
'5:7': '[a]And now, my sons, listen to me,<br>And do not depart from the words of my mouth.',
'5:8': 'Keep your way far from her,<br>And do not go near the door of her house;',
'5:9': 'Lest you give your honor to others,<br>And your years to the cruel;',
'5:10': 'Lest strangers be filled with your wealth,<br>And your labors go to the house of a foreigner,',
'5:11': 'And you mourn at your end,<br>When your flesh and your body are consumed,',
'5:12': 'And you say, How I have hated instruction,<br>And my heart has despised reproof!',
'5:13': 'And I have not listened to the voice of my teachers<br>Nor inclined my ear to my instructors;',
'5:14': 'I was almost into every evil<br>In the midst of the congregation and assembly.',
'5:15': 'Drink waters out of your own cistern,<br>And running water out of your own well.',
'5:16': 'Should your springs be shed forth,<br>Like streams of water in the streets?',
'5:17': 'Let them be yours alone,<br>And not for strangers with you.',
'5:18': 'Let your fountain be blessed,<br>And rejoice in the [a]wife of your youth,',
'5:19': 'A lovely [a]hind and a graceful doe.<br>Let her breasts satisfy you at all times.<br>May you be ravished with her love always.',
'5:20': 'For why should you be ravished, my son, with a strange woman<br>And embrace the bosom of an adulteress?',
'5:21': 'For the ways of a man are before the [a]eyes of Jehovah,<br>And He ponders all his paths.',
'5:22': 'The wicked man is taken by his own iniquities,<br>And he is held fast by the cords of his own sin.',
'5:23': 'He will die for lack of instruction,<br>And in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.',
'6:1': 'My son, if you have become a surety for your neighbor,<br>If you have given your hands as a pledge for a stranger,',
'6:2': 'You are snared by the words of your mouth;<br>You are caught by the words of your mouth.',
'6:3': 'Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself,<br>Since you have come into the hand of your neighbor:<br>Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.',
'6:4': 'Do not give [a]sleep to your eyes,<br>Nor slumber to your eyelids.',
'6:5': 'Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hunter&rsquo;s hand<br>And like a bird from the fowler&rsquo;s hand.',
'6:6': 'Go to the [a]ant, you sluggard;<br>Consider its ways, and be wise,',
'6:7': 'Which, having no chief,<br>Officer, or ruler,',
'6:8': 'Prepares its food in summer<br>And gathers its sustenance in the harvest.',
'6:9': 'How long, sluggard, will you lie there?<br>When will you arise from your sleep?',
'6:10': '[a]A little sleep, a little slumber,<br>A little folding of the hands to rest,',
'6:11': 'And your poverty will come upon you like a robber,<br>And your want, like an armed man.',
'6:12': 'A worthless man, a wicked man,<br>Goes around with a perverse mouth,',
'6:13': 'Winking with his eyes, signaling with his feet,<br>Pointing with his fingers;',
'6:14': 'With perverseness in his [a]heart, he is devising evil continually;<br>He injects discord.',
'6:15': 'Therefore his calamity will come suddenly;<br>In a moment he will be broken, and there will be no remedy.',
'6:16': 'There are six things that Jehovah hates;<br>Indeed, seven that are an abomination to His soul:',
'6:17': 'Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,<br>And hands that shed innocent blood,',
'6:18': 'A heart that devises wicked schemes,<br>[a]Feet that hurry to run to evil,',
'6:19': 'A false witness who utters lies,<br>And one who injects [a]discord among brothers.',
'6:20': '[a]My son, keep the commandment of your father,<br>And do not reject the teaching of your mother;',
'6:21': '[a]Bind them continually on your heart;<br>Tie them around your neck.',
'6:22': 'When you [a]walk about, it will guide you,<br>When you lie down, it will watch over you;<br>And when you awake, it will talk with you.',
'6:23': 'For the commandment is a [a]lamp, and the teaching a light,<br>And the reproofs of instruction are the way of life,',
'6:24': 'To keep you from the evil woman,<br>From the smooth tongue of the adulteress.',
'6:25': 'Do not desire her beauty in your heart,<br>Nor let her catch you with her eyelids;',
'6:26': 'For the price of a harlot is a loaf of bread,<br>But the wife of another man hunts for the precious soul.',
'6:27': 'Can a man take fire in his bosom<br>And his clothes not be burned?',
'6:28': 'Can a man walk on hot coals<br>And his feet not be scorched?',
'6:29': 'So it is with him who goes in to his neighbor&rsquo;s wife;<br>No one who touches her will be unpunished.',
'6:30': 'The thief is not despised if he steals<br>To satisfy himself when he is hungry;',
'6:31': 'But if he is found out, he shall restore sevenfold;<br>He must give over all the substance of his house.',
'6:32': 'He who commits [a]adultery with a woman lacks sense;<br>He who does it destroys his own soul.',
'6:33': 'He will find wounds and dishonor,<br>And his reproach will not be wiped away.',
'6:34': 'For jealousy is the rage of a man,<br>And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.',
'6:35': 'He will not regard any ransom,<br>Nor will he be content if you give him great gifts.',
'7:1': '[a]My son, keep my words,<br>And treasure up my commandments within you.',
'7:2': 'Keep my commandments, and live;<br>And my teaching, like the apple of your eye.',
'7:3': 'Bind them on your fingers;<br>Write them on the [a]tablet of your heart.',
'7:4': 'Say to wisdom, You are my sister,<br>And call understanding your close friend,',
'7:5': 'That they may keep you from the strange woman,<br>From the adulteress who flatters with her words.',
'7:6': 'For at the window of my house<br>I looked out through my lattice,',
'7:7': 'And I saw among the simple ones,<br>I discerned among the youths,<br>A young man lacking sense,',
'7:8': 'Passing along the street near her corner;<br>And he takes the way to her house,',
'7:9': 'In the twilight, in the evening of the day,<br>In the deep of night and darkness.',
'7:10': 'And there comes a woman to meet him,<br>Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart.',
'7:11': 'She is rowdy and defiant;<br>Her feet do not stay at home&mdash;',
'7:12': 'Now in the street, now in the squares,<br>And at every corner she lies in wait.',
'7:13': 'And she grabs him and kisses him;<br>And with an impudent face she says to him,',
'7:14': 'I had to make offerings;<br>Today I have paid my vows.',
'7:15': 'Therefore I have come out to meet you,<br>To earnestly seek your presence; and I have found you.',
'7:16': 'I have decked my couch with coverings,<br>Colored spreads of the linen of Egypt;',
'7:17': 'I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh,<br>Aloes, and cinnamon.',
'7:18': 'Come, let us drink our fill of love until the morning;<br>Let us delight ourselves with love.',
'7:19': 'For my husband is not at home;<br>He has gone on a long journey.',
'7:20': 'He has taken the money bag with him;<br>He will come home at the full moon.',
'7:21': 'With her great persuasiveness she beguiles him;<br>With her smooth talk she compels him.',
'7:22': 'He goes after her immediately,<br>As an ox goes to the slaughter,<br>Or as someone in fetters, to the correction of the fool,',
'7:23': 'Until an arrow pierces through his liver.<br>As a bird hastens to the snare,<br>So he does not know that this will cost him his life.',
'7:24': '[a]And now, my sons, listen to me,<br>And pay attention to the words of my mouth.',
'7:25': 'Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways;<br>Do not stray into her paths.',
'7:26': 'For many are those whom she has brought down wounded,<br>And numerous are all who have been slain by her.',
'7:27': 'Her house is the way to Sheol,<br>Going down to the chambers of death.',
'8:1': 'Does not wisdom [a]call,<br>And understanding lift up her voice?',
'8:2': 'On the top of the heights, by the way,<br>Where the paths meet, she takes her stand;',
'8:3': 'Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,<br>At the entrance of the doors, she cries aloud:',
'8:4': 'To you, O men, I call;<br>And my voice is to the sons of men.',
'8:5': 'O simple ones, understand prudence;<br>And, O fools, be of an understanding heart.',
'8:6': 'Hear, for I will speak noble things;<br>And the opening of my lips will yield right things.',
'8:7': 'For my mouth will utter truth,<br>And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.',
'8:8': 'All the [a]words of my mouth are in righteousness;<br>There is nothing twisted or crooked in them.',
'8:9': 'They are all straight to him who understands,<br>And right to those who find knowledge.',
'8:10': 'Receive my instruction, and not silver;<br>And knowledge rather than choice gold.',
'8:11': '[a]For wisdom is better than corals,<br>And nothing that you desire compares with her.',
'8:12': '[1]I, wisdom, dwell with prudence,<br>And I find knowledge and discretion.',
'8:13': 'The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil;<br>Pride and arrogance and the evil way<br>And the perverse mouth, I hate.',
'8:14': 'Counsel is mine and sound wisdom;<br>I am understanding; I have might.',
'8:15': 'By me kings [a]reign,<br>And rulers decree justice.',
'8:16': 'By me princes rule,<br>And nobles&mdash;all who judge righteously.',

'8:18': 'Riches and honor are with me,<br>Enduring wealth and righteousness.',
'8:19': 'My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold;<br>And my yield than choice silver.',
'8:20': 'I walk in the [a]way of righteousness,<br>In the midst of the paths of justice,',
'8:21': 'That I may cause those who love me to inherit substance<br>And that I may fill their treasuries.',
'8:22': 'Jehovah possessed me in the [a]beginning of His way,<br>Before His works of old.',
'8:23': 'I was set up from eternity,<br>From the beginning, before the earth was.',
'8:24': 'When there were no depths, I was [a]brought forth,<br>When there were no fountains abounding with water.',
'8:25': 'Before the mountains were settled,<br>Before the hills, I was brought forth;',
'8:26': 'When He had not yet made the earth and the fields,<br>Nor the first dust of the world.',
'8:27': 'When He [a]established the heavens, I was there;<br>When He inscribed a [b]circle upon the surface of the deep,',
'8:28': 'When He made [a]firm the skies above,<br>When the fountains of the deep became strong,',
'8:29': 'When He set for the sea its [a]boundary,<br>That the waters should not transgress His commandment,<br>When He marked out the foundations of the earth;',
'8:30': 'Then I was by Him, as a master workman;<br>And I was daily His [a]delight,<br>Rejoicing always before Him,',
'8:31': 'Rejoicing in His habitable earth;<br>And my delight was in the sons of men.',
'8:32': 'Now therefore, my sons, listen to me;<br>For blessed are they who keep my ways.',
'8:33': 'Hear instruction, and be wise;<br>And do not neglect it.',
'8:34': 'Blessed is the man who listens to me,<br>Watching daily at my doors,<br>Waiting at my doorposts.',

'9:6': 'Forsake foolishness, and live,<br>And walk in the way of understanding.',
'9:7': 'He who corrects a scorner gets dishonor for himself,<br>And he who reproves a wicked man blemishes himself.',
'9:8': 'Do not reprove a scorner, lest he hate you;<br>Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.',

{sup:"1a", word:"proverbs", vrefs:"1&nbsp;Kings 4:32; Prov. 10:1; 25:1; Eccl. 12:9", lines:["Heb. mishle, meaning similitudes, proverbs, parables, to represent general truths. Proverbs is a collection of the words of the wise. It stresses the wisdom that man receives of God through his contacting of God and that teaches man how to behave and build up his character in his human life. Since the proverbs were collected mainly by two kings of Judah (Solomon and Hezekiah) in the age of the law, the book of Proverbs may be considered a subsidiary to the law. The law is the portrait of God; as such, it demands that God&rsquo;s people keep it so that they may be made copies of God for His expression and glorification (see {Exo20:1^1|note 1<sup>1</sup>} in {Exo20|Exo. 20}). Proverbs, as a subsidiary to the law, instructs people how to behave and how to build themselves up according to God&rsquo;s attributes, i.e., according to what God is.","As a part of the holy word in God&rsquo;s Holy Scriptures, Proverbs should be considered the breath of God for us to breathe in that we may receive the life supply from God ({2Ti3:16|2&nbsp;Tim. 3:16}). Hence, we should read Proverbs by being filled with the fullness of God in our spirit ({Eph5:18|Eph. 5:18}; {Eph3:19|3:19}). Furthermore, we should read Proverbs in the New Testament Spirit of life ({Rom8:2|Rom. 8:2}), with our regenerated spirit, mingling prayer with our reading ({Eph6:17|Eph. 6:17}-{Eph6:18|18}) in order to mingle the words with spirit and life (cf. {Joh6:63|John 6:63}). While we are still living in this body, we need Proverbs to give us instructions on how to live rightly in many aspects. However, according to God&rsquo;s economy Proverbs should not be used to build up the old man by cultivating our self and our natural man. Rather, we should reject self-cultivation and condemn the building up of the natural man (cf. {Mat16:24|Matt. 16:24}; {Rom6:6|Rom. 6:6}; {Gal2:20|Gal. 2:20}) and come to Proverbs as a new man ({Eph4:22|Eph. 4:22}-{Eph4:24|24}) by exercising our spirit with the Spirit to contact the word in the spirit of prayer. Then the word in Proverbs will become spirit and life to us, not to cultivate our natural man but to cultivate our regenerated new man. We must be persons who love the Lord and pursue Christ, not self-perfection (cf. {Phi3:3|Phil. 3:3}-{Phi3:14|14}), and who love the Lord&rsquo;s word in the entire Bible and read it with a praying spirit, not to seek the doctrine of letters but to seek the Spirit and word of life (cf. {Joh5:39|John 5:39}-{Joh5:40|40}; {2Co3:6|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6}), and not to gain any help for self-cultivation but to nourish our spirit that we may live a Christian life that is perfect in the divine virtues, which are the expressions of the divine attributes. If we are such persons, this book will render us nuggets and gems to strengthen our life of pursuing Christ for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy in producing and building up the Body of Christ, which consummates the New Jerusalem as God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and ultimate goal."]},
