'1:1': '[1]Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and a brother of [1]James, to those who are [a]called, [b]beloved in God the Father, and [c]kept [2]by Jesus Christ:',
'1:2': '[1a]Mercy to you and [b]peace and [c]love be multiplied.',
'1:3': 'Beloved, while using all diligence to write to you concerning our [1]common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you <I>and</I> exhort <I>you</I> to earnestly [2a]contend for the [3]faith once for all delivered to the [b]saints.',
'1:4': '[1]For certain men have [2a]crept in unnoticed, who of old have been [3]written of beforehand for [4]this judgment, [b]ungodly men, [5]perverting the [c]grace of our God into [6d]licentiousness and [5e]denying [7]our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.',
'1:5': 'But I intend to [a]remind you, though you know all things once for all, that [1]the Lord, having saved a people [b]out of the land of Egypt, [2]afterward [3c]destroyed those who did not believe;',
'1:6': 'And [a]angels who did not keep their own [1]principality but abandoned their [2]own dwelling place, He has kept in eternal [b]bonds under [3]gloom for the [4c]judgment of the great day;',
'1:7': 'How [a]Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who [1]in like manner with these gave themselves over to fornication and went after [b]different flesh, are set forth as an [c]example, undergoing the [d]penalty of eternal fire.',
'1:8': 'Nevertheless in like manner [1]these dreamers also [a]defile the flesh and despise [2]lordship and revile [3]dignities.',
'1:9': 'But [1a]Michael the [b]archangel, when he contended with the [c]devil and disputed concerning the [2]body of Moses, [3]did not dare to bring a [d]reviling judgment against <I>him</I> but said, The Lord [e]rebuke you.',
'1:10': 'But [1]these revile the things that they do not [2]know; and the things that they [2]understand [3]naturally, like [4a]animals [5]without reason, [6]in these they are being [7]corrupted.',
'1:11': '[a]Woe to them! For they have gone in the [1]way of [b]Cain and have [2]rushed out in the [3]error of [c]Balaam for reward and have [4d]perished in the [5]rebellion of Korah.',
'1:12': 'These are the [1]hidden reefs in your [2]love feasts, [a]feasting together with <I>you</I> without fear, [3b]shepherding themselves; [4c]waterless clouds being carried off by [d]winds; [5]autumn trees [e]without fruit, having died twice, [f]rooted up;',
'1:13': '[1]Wild [a]waves of the sea, foaming out their own [b]shames; [2]wandering stars, for whom the [c]gloom of darkness is kept for eternity.',
'1:14': 'And [a]Enoch, the seventh from Adam, [b]prophesied also of these, saying, Behold, the Lord [1c]came [2]with [3]myriads of His saints',
'1:15': 'To execute [1]judgment against all and to convict all the [a]ungodly concerning all their ungodly works which they have done in ungodliness, and concerning all the hard things which ungodly sinners have [b]spoken against Him.',
'1:16': 'These are [a]murmurers, complainers, going on according to their own [b]lusts; and their mouth speaks [c]great swelling things, [d]flattering [1]persons for the sake of [e]advantage.',
'1:17': 'But you, beloved, [a]remember the words spoken before by the [b]apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,',
'1:18': 'That they said to you, In the [1a]last time there will be [b]mockers, going on according to their own [c]lusts for [d]ungodliness.',
'1:19': 'These are those who make [a]divisions, [1b]soulish, having no [2]spirit.',
'1:20': 'But you, beloved, [a]building up yourselves [1]upon your most holy [2]faith, praying in the Holy [b]Spirit,',
'1:21': '[1]Keep yourselves in the [a]love of God, [b]awaiting the [2]mercy of our [3]Lord Jesus Christ [4]unto [c]eternal life.',
'1:22': 'And [1]on some have mercy, on those who are [2]wavering;',
'1:23': '[a]Save <I>them</I> by [1b]snatching <I>them</I> out of the [2]fire. On others have mercy [3]in [c]fear, hating even the inner garment [d]spotted from the [e]flesh.',
'1:24': '[1a]But to Him who is [b]able to [c]guard you from [d]stumbling and to set <I>you</I> before His [2]glory [e]without blemish [3]in [4f]exultation,',
'1:25': 'To the [a]only [1]God our [b]Savior through [1]Jesus Christ our Lord be [2c]glory, majesty, might, and authority [3]before all time and now and unto all eternity. <I>Amen.</I>',
