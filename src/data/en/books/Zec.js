verses: {
'1:1': 'In the eighth month, in the [a]second year of [1]Darius, the word of Jehovah came to [2b]Zechariah the prophet, the son of [3]Berechiah, the son of [4]Iddo, saying,',
'1:2': 'Jehovah was extremely angry with your fathers;',
'1:3': 'Therefore say to them, Thus says Jehovah [1]of hosts, [2a]Return to Me, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will return to you, says Jehovah of hosts.',
'1:4': 'Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets [a]cried, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Turn from your evil ways and from your evil deeds; but they did not hear nor hearken to Me, declares Jehovah.',
'1:5': 'Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?',
'1:6': 'But My words and My statutes, which I commanded My servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers, so that they returned and said, As Jehovah of hosts has [a]thought to do with us, according to our ways and according to our deeds, so has He done with us?',
'1:7': 'On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the prophet, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,',
'1:8': 'I saw during the night, and behold, a [1]man was riding upon a [2a]red horse; and He was standing among the [3]myrtle trees that were in the bottoms; and behind Him there were [4]red, reddish-brown, and white horses.',
'1:9': 'Then I said, What are these, sir? And the angel who spoke with me said to me, I will show you what these are.',
'1:10': 'And the man who stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom Jehovah has [1]sent to go to and fro on the earth.',
'1:11': 'And they answered the Angel of Jehovah, who was standing among the myrtle trees, and they said, We have gone to and fro on the earth, and indeed all the earth sits [a]still and is quiet.',
'1:12': 'Then the Angel of Jehovah answered and said, O Jehovah of hosts, how long will You not have compassion on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, with which You have been indignant for these [a]seventy years?',
'1:13': 'And Jehovah answered the angel who spoke with me with good words, with comforting words.',
'1:14': 'So the angel who spoke to me said to me, Cry out, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts: I am greatly [1a]jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion;',
'1:15': 'And I am extremely angry with the nations, who are at ease; for I was only a little [a]angry, but their help increased the affliction.',
'1:16': 'Therefore thus says Jehovah, I return to Jerusalem with [a]compassions; My [b]house will be built in it, declares Jehovah of hosts, and a [1c]measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.',
'1:17': 'Cry out again, saying, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, My cities will again overflow with good, and Jehovah will again [a]comfort Zion and will again choose Jerusalem.',
'1:18': 'Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and there were [1]four horns.',
'1:19': 'And I said to the angel who spoke with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the [a]horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.',
'1:20': 'Then Jehovah showed me [1]four craftsmen.',
'1:21': 'And I said, What do these come to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns that have so [a]scattered Judah that no man lifts up his head, but these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who have lifted up the horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.',
'2:1': 'Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there was a [1]man, and in His hand was a [2a]measuring line.',
'2:2': 'And I said, Where are you going? And He said to me, To [a]measure [1]Jerusalem; to see how great its breadth is and how great its length is.',
'2:3': 'Then at that point the angel who spoke with me went forth and another angel came forth to meet him.',
'2:4': 'And he said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will lie as an open region due to the multitude of men and cattle within it,',
'2:5': 'For I will be her [1]wall of fire round about, declares Jehovah, and I will be the [1a]glory within her.',
'2:6': 'Ho! Ho! [a]Flee from the land of the north, declares Jehovah, for I have [1]spread you out like the [b]four winds of the heavens, declares Jehovah.',
'2:7': 'Ho, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.',
'2:8': 'For thus says Jehovah of hosts, [1]After the glory [2]He has sent [2]Me against the nations who plunder you; for he who touches you touches the [3a]pupil of His eye.',
'2:9': 'For I am now waving My hand over them, and they will be plunder for those who served them; and you will [a]know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me.',
'2:10': 'Give a [a]ringing shout and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for now [1]I am coming, and I will dwell in your [b]midst, declares Jehovah.',
'2:11': 'And many [a]nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day and will become My people; and I will dwell in your midst, and you will know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.',
'2:12': 'And Jehovah will inherit Judah as His [a]portion upon the holy land, and He will again choose Jerusalem.',
'2:13': '[1a]Hush, all flesh, before Jehovah! For He is roused up from His [b]holy habitation.',
'3:1': 'Then He showed me [1a]Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah and [2]Satan standing at his [b]right hand to be his adversary.',
'3:2': 'And Jehovah said to Satan, Jehovah [a]rebuke you, Satan! Indeed, Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebuke you! Is this not a brand plucked from the [b]fire?',
'3:3': 'Now Joshua was clothed with [1]filthy [a]garments and was standing before the Angel.',
'3:4': 'And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, [1]Remove the filthy garments from him. Then He said to him, See, I hereby make your iniquity pass from you and [a]clothe you with stately robes.',
'3:5': 'And [1]He said, Let them put a [2]clean [a]turban upon his head. And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by.',
'3:6': 'And the Angel of Jehovah testified to Joshua, saying,',
'3:7': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If you will walk in My ways and if you will keep My charge, then you will both judge My house and keep My courts, and I will grant you to walk among these standing here.',
'3:8': 'Hear then, Joshua the high priest, you and your fellows who sit before you&mdash;for they are men of symbol&mdash;for I am about to bring forth My [1a]servant, the [b]shoot.',
'3:9': 'For here is the [1a]stone that I have set before Joshua&mdash;upon one stone are [2b]seven eyes. I will [3]engrave its engraving, declares Jehovah of hosts, and I will [4]remove the iniquity of that land in one day.',
'3:10': 'In that day, declares Jehovah of hosts, each of you will invite his neighbor to come under the [1a]vine and under the fig tree.',
'4:1': '[1]Then the angel who spoke with me returned and roused me as a man is roused from his sleep.',
'4:2': 'And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see that there is a [1a]lampstand all of gold, with its bowl on top of it and its [b]seven lamps upon it, with [2]seven pipes for each of the lamps on top of it;',
'4:3': 'And there are [1]two [a]olive trees beside it, one to the right of the bowl and one to the left.',
'4:4': 'And I answered and spoke to the angel who spoke with me, saying, What are these, sir?',
'4:5': 'And the angel who spoke with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir.',
'4:6': 'And he answered and spoke to me, saying, [1]This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by [a]might nor by power, but by My [2]Spirit, says Jehovah of hosts.',
'4:7': 'Who are you, O great [a]mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain, and he will [1]bring forth the [b]topstone with [c]shouts of Grace, grace to it.',
'4:8': 'Moreover the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,',
'4:9': 'The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the [a]foundation of this house, and his hands will [b]finish it; and you will [c]know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you.',
'4:10': 'For who has despised the day of [a]small things? For these [1]seven rejoice when they see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel; they are the [b]eyes of Jehovah running to and fro on the whole earth.',
'4:11': 'Then I answered and said to him, What are these two [a]olive trees on the right of the lampstand and on its left?',
'4:12': 'And I answered a second time and said to him, What are the two olive [1]branches that are by the side of the two golden spouts, [2]which empty the [3]gold from themselves?',
'4:13': 'And he spoke to me, saying, Do you not know what these are? And I said, No, sir.',
'4:14': 'And he said, These are the two [a]sons of oil, who stand by the [b]Lord of the whole earth.',
'5:1': '[1]Then I lifted up my eyes again and I saw, and there was a [2]flying [a]scroll.',
'5:2': 'And he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a flying scroll, its [1]length twenty cubits and its breadth ten cubits.',
'5:3': 'Then he said to me, This is the [1a]curse that goes forth over the face of all the land; for everyone who [2]steals will be purged according to what is on one side, and everyone who [2]swears will be purged according to what is on the other side.',
'5:4': 'I will cause [1]it to go forth, declares Jehovah of hosts; and it will enter the house of him who steals and the house of him who swears falsely by My name; and it will lodge overnight within his house and [a]consume it, both with its timbers and its stones.',
'5:5': 'Then the angel who spoke with me went forth and said to me, Lift up now your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.',
'5:6': 'And I said, What is it? And he said, This is [1]the ephah vessel that goes forth; and he said, This is their [2]appearance in all the land;',
'5:7': '(Then a lead cover was lifted up) and this is a [1]woman sitting within the ephah vessel.',
'5:8': 'Then he said, This is Wickedness. And he threw her down into the midst of the ephah vessel and threw the [1]lead weight over its opening.',
'5:9': 'Then I lifted up my eyes and I looked, and there were [1]two women going forth, and the wind was in their wings; and they had wings like the wings of a stork. And they lifted up the ephah vessel between the earth and the heavens.',
'5:10': 'And I said to the angel who spoke with me, Where are they taking the ephah vessel?',
'5:11': 'And he said to me, [1]To build a house for her in the land of [a]Shinar; and when it is prepared, she will be set there in her own place.',
'6:1': 'Then I lifted up my eyes again and I looked, and there were [1]four chariots coming forth from between the [2]two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of [3]bronze.',
'6:2': 'With the first chariot were [a]red [1]horses, and with the second chariot were black horses,',
'6:3': 'And with the third chariot were white horses, and with the fourth chariot were strong, speckled horses.',
'6:4': 'And I answered and said to the angel who spoke with me, What are these, sir?',
'6:5': 'And the angel answered and said to me, These are the [a]four winds of heaven who go forth from presenting themselves to the Lord of the whole earth.',
'6:6': 'With [1]one of the winds the black horses went forth to the land of the [a]north, and the white horses went forth after them, and the speckled horses went forth to the land of the south.',
'6:7': 'And the strong horses went forth and sought to proceed to go to and fro on the earth. And He said, Proceed to [a]go to and fro on the earth; and they went to and fro on the earth.',
'6:8': 'Then He called out to me and spoke to me, saying, See, these who are going forth to the land of the north have given My Spirit [1a]rest in the land of the north.',
'6:9': 'And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,',
'6:10': 'Take from them of the captivity, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, and go the same day and enter the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, where they have come from Babylon.',
'6:11': 'Indeed, take the silver and gold, and make a [1]splendid [a]crown and put it upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest,',
'6:12': 'And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the [a]Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will [1]build the [b]temple of Jehovah.',
'6:13': 'Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a [a]priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be [1]between the two of them.',
'6:14': 'And the splendid crown will be as a [1]reminder in the temple of Jehovah to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah.',
'6:15': 'And those who are [a]far off will come and build the temple of Jehovah, and you will [b]know that Jehovah of hosts has sent Me to you. And it will happen, if you fully obey the voice of Jehovah your God.',
'7:1': 'And in the fourth year of Darius the king the word of Jehovah came to [a]Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, the month Chislev.',
'7:2': 'Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech and their men to entreat the favor of Jehovah',
'7:3': 'By speaking to the priests who belong to the house of Jehovah of hosts and to the prophets, saying, Shall I [1]weep in the fifth month and separate myself, as I have done these many years?',
'7:4': 'Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,',
'7:5': 'Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, When you [a]fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months, even for these [b]seventy years, was it at all for Me that you fasted?',
'7:6': 'And when you eat and when you drink, are you not the ones eating and are you not the ones drinking?',
'7:7': 'Are not these the words which Jehovah proclaimed by the former prophets when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous and had cities round about her, when the [1]Negev and the lowlands were inhabited?',
'7:8': 'And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah, saying,',
'7:9': 'Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Judge with judgment of truth, and show lovingkindness and compassion each to his brother;',
'7:10': 'And do not oppress the widow and the orphan, the stranger and the poor; and let none of you think evil in your hearts about his brother.',
'7:11': 'But they refused to listen, and they turned a stubborn shoulder and closed their ears from hearing;',
'7:12': 'And they set their hearts like adamant so as not to hear the instruction and the words which Jehovah of hosts sent by His Spirit through the former prophets; therefore great wrath came from Jehovah of hosts.',
'7:13': 'And as He called and they would not hear, so they called and I would not hear, says Jehovah of hosts;',
'7:14': 'But with a storm I [a]scattered them away upon all the nations, whom they did not know. Thus the land is desolate behind them, so that no one passes through it and no one returns to it; for they have made the [b]desirable land desolate.',
'8:1': '[1]And the word of Jehovah of hosts came, saying,',
'8:2': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I am [a]jealous for Zion with great jealousy; indeed, I am jealous for her with great wrath.',
'8:3': 'Thus says Jehovah, I [a]return to Zion, and I will dwell [b]within Jerusalem; and Jerusalem will be called the [c]City of Truth, and the [d]mountain of Jehovah of hosts, the Holy Mountain.',
'8:4': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, Yet again old men and old women will dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, each with his staff in his hand due to the multitude of his days.',
'8:5': 'And the streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing in its streets.',
'8:6': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, If it seems too [1]wonderful in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, will it also be too wonderful in My sight? declares Jehovah of hosts.',
'8:7': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I am about to [a]save My people from the land of the east and from the land of the going down of the sun.',
'8:8': 'And I will bring them, and they will dwell within Jerusalem; and they will be My [a]people and I will be their God in [b]truth and in righteousness.',
'8:9': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, [1]Let your hands be strong, you who in these days hear these words from the mouth of the prophets who were there in the [a]day when the foundation of the house of Jehovah of hosts, that is, the temple, was laid so that it might be built.',
'8:10': 'For before those days a man&rsquo;s [a]wages amounted to nothing, and an animal&rsquo;s wages were nothing; and for him who went out or came in there was no peace, because of the adversary; for I set all men each against his neighbor.',
'8:11': 'But now I will not be to the remnant of this people as I was in the former days, declares Jehovah of hosts;',
'8:12': 'For there will be peace for the seed: The vine will give forth its [a]fruit, and the land will give forth its produce, and the heavens will give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.',
'8:13': 'And just as you were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not fear; let your hands be strong.',
'8:14': 'For thus says Jehovah of hosts, Just as I intended to do harm to you when your fathers provoked Me to anger, says Jehovah of hosts, and I did not repent,',
'8:15': 'So again I intend in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; do not fear.',
'8:16': 'These are the things which you shall do: Each man speak [a]truth to his neighbor; judge with truth and the judgment of peace in your gates;',
'8:17': 'And let none of you think evil in your hearts about his neighbor; and do not love a false oath; for all these are the things I hate, declares Jehovah.',
'8:18': 'Then the word of Jehovah of hosts came to me, saying,',
'8:19': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the [a]fifth month and the fast of the [b]seventh month and the fast of the tenth month will become joy and rejoicing and cheerful feasts to the house of Judah; therefore love truth and peace.',
'8:20': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, [1]Peoples will again come, even the inhabitants of many cities;',
'8:21': 'And the inhabitants of one will go to another, saying, Let us go at once to entreat the favor of Jehovah and to seek Jehovah of hosts; and the other: I will go too.',
'8:22': 'Indeed, many peoples and strong nations will come to [a]seek Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of Jehovah.',
'8:23': 'Thus says Jehovah of hosts, In those days, from all the [1]languages of the [a]nations, ten men will take hold, indeed, they will take hold of the skirt of a Jewish man, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.',
'9:1': '[1]The burden of the word of Jehovah against the [2]land of Hadrach,<br>And [a]Damascus will be its resting place<br>(For Jehovah has an eye on man,<br>Especially on the tribes of Israel),',
'9:2': 'And Hamath also, which borders on it;<br>Tyre and Sidon, because they are very wise.',
'9:3': 'For [a]Tyre built herself a stronghold<br>And heaped up silver like dust<br>And gold like the mire of the streets.',
'9:4': 'The Lord is about to take possession of her,<br>And He will strike her might in the sea,<br>And she will be consumed with fire.',
'9:5': '[a]Ashkelon will see it and be afraid;<br>Gaza also, and it will writhe much in anguish;<br>And Ekron, for her expectation will have been confounded.<br>And the king will perish from Gaza,<br>And Ashkelon will not be inhabited.',
'9:6': 'And a mixed race will dwell in Ashdod,<br>And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.',
'9:7': 'And I will remove his blood from his mouth<br>And his detestable things from between his teeth;<br>And he also will remain unto our God;<br>And he will be like a leader in Judah,<br>And Ekron will be like a Jebusite.',
'9:8': 'And I will [a]encamp around My [1]house because of an army,<br>Because of him who passes by and returns;<br>And no oppressor will pass over them any more;<br>For now I see with My eyes.',
'9:9': '[1]Exult greatly, O [a]daughter of Zion;<br>Shout, O [b]daughter of Jerusalem!<br>Now your [c]King comes to you.<br>He is righteous and bears salvation,<br>Lowly and riding upon a donkey,<br>Even upon a [d]colt, the foal of a donkey,',
'9:10': '[1]And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim<br>And the horse from Jerusalem,<br>And the battle bow will be cut off;<br>And He will speak peace unto the nations,<br>And His [a]dominion will be from sea to sea<br>And from the [2]River unto the ends of the earth.',
'9:11': '[1]As for you also, because of the [a]blood of your covenant,<br>I have [b]released your captives from the pit, where there is no water.',
'9:12': 'Turn to the stronghold, O prisoners with hope.<br>This very day I am declaring that I will restore [a]double to you.',
'9:13': 'For I will bend Judah for Myself,<br>And I will fill a bow with Ephraim;<br>And I will stir up your [a]sons, O Zion,<br>Against your sons, O [1]Javan;<br>And I will make you like a warrior&rsquo;s sword.',
'9:14': 'And Jehovah will appear above [1]them,<br>And His arrow will go forth like lightning;<br>And the Lord Jehovah will blow the [a]trumpet,<br>And He will go in the whirlwinds of the south.',
'9:15': 'Jehovah of hosts will [a]defend them;<br>And they will devour and trample the sling stones.<br>And they will drink; they will be noisy as if with wine;<br>And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin,<br>Like the corners of the altar.',
'9:16': 'And Jehovah their God will save them in [1]that day as the flock of His people,<br>For they will be like the stones of a crown, sparkling in His land.',
'9:17': 'For how [1]great is their goodness, and how great their beauty!<br>Grain will make the young men flourish,<br>And new wine, the virgins.',
'10:1': 'Ask [1a]rain of Jehovah<br>At the time of spring rain,<br>Of Jehovah who makes the lightning,<br>And He will give them showers of rain,<br>To everyone herbage in the field.',
'10:2': 'For the [1]teraphim have spoken [2]vanity,<br>And the diviners have seen a lie<br>And have spoken false dreams;<br>They comforted in vain.<br>Therefore the people have wandered like sheep;<br>They are afflicted because there is [a]no shepherd.',
'10:3': 'My anger is kindled against the shepherds,<br>And I will punish the [1a]male goats;<br>For Jehovah of hosts has [2]visited His flock, the house of Judah,<br>And will make them like His [3]horse of majesty in battle.',
'10:4': 'From [1]him will come forth the cornerstone, from him the [a]peg,<br>From him the battle bow,<br>From him every ruler together.',
'10:5': 'And they will be as mighty men trampling their enemies<br>In the mire of the streets in the battle;<br>And they will fight, for Jehovah is with them;<br>And the riders of horses will be put to shame.',
'10:6': 'And I will strengthen the house of Judah,<br>And I will save the house of Joseph;<br>And I will [a]bring them back, for I have had compassion on them;<br>And they will be as though I had not rejected them;<br>For I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.',
'10:7': 'And they of Ephraim will be like a mighty man,<br>And their hearts will rejoice as if with wine;<br>Indeed, their children will see it and rejoice;<br>Their heart will exult in Jehovah.',
'10:8': 'I will whistle for them and gather them, for I have redeemed them;<br>And they will [a]multiply as they have multiplied.',
'10:9': 'And I will [a]sow them among the peoples; and in distant lands they will<br>[b]remember Me;<br>And they will live with their children and return.',
'10:10': 'I will also bring them back from the land of [a]Egypt<br>And gather them out of Assyria;<br>And to the land of Gilead and Lebanon I will bring them;<br>And there will not be enough room found for them.',
'10:11': 'And He will pass through the sea of distress<br>And strike the waves in the sea,<br>And all the depths of the Nile will [a]dry up;<br>And the pride of Assyria will be brought down,<br>And the scepter of Egypt will depart.',
'10:12': 'And [1]I will strengthen them in Jehovah,<br>And they will [a]walk about in His name,<br>Declares Jehovah.',
'11:1': 'Open your doors, O Lebanon,<br>That the [1]fire may devour your cedars.',
'11:2': 'Howl, O fir tree, for the cedar has fallen,<br>Because the majestic trees are devastated.<br>Howl, O oaks of Bashan,<br>For the impenetrable forest is brought down.',
'11:3': 'The sound of the howling of shepherds!<br>For their majesty is devastated.<br>The sound of the roaring of young lions!<br>For the pride of Jordan is devastated.',
'11:4': 'Thus says Jehovah my God, Shepherd the flock of slaughter,',
'11:5': 'Whose owners slaughter them and are not punished; and they who sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah, for I am rich; and their own shepherds do not spare them.',
'11:6': 'For I will no longer spare the inhabitants of the land, declares Jehovah; but I am about to cause each man to fall into his [1]neighbor&rsquo;s hand and into the hand of his king; and they will strike the land, and I will not deliver them from their hand.',
'11:7': 'So [1]I shepherded the flock of slaughter, and thereby the afflicted of the flock. And I took to myself two staffs; one I called [2]Favor, and the other I called Bonds; and I shepherded the flock.',
'11:8': 'Then I destroyed the [1]three shepherds in one month; for my soul was impatient with them, and their soul also detested me.',
'11:9': 'Then I said, I will not shepherd you. What is to die will die, and what is to be destroyed will be destroyed, and those who are left will each eat one another&rsquo;s flesh.',
'11:10': 'And I took my staff, Favor, and I [1]broke it in pieces so as to break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.',
'11:11': 'And it was broken in that day; and thus the afflicted of the flock, who watched me, knew that it was the word of Jehovah.',
'11:12': 'And I said to them, If it is good in your sight, give me my wages; but if not, [1]do not bother. So they weighed out my wages, [2a]thirty pieces of silver.',
'11:13': 'And Jehovah said to me, Throw it to the [a]potter, that magnificent price that I am priced with by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them to the potter, into the house of Jehovah.',
'11:14': 'Then I [1]broke my second staff, Bonds, in pieces, so as to break the brotherhood [a]between Judah and Israel.',
'11:15': 'And Jehovah said to me, Again, take the equipment of a [1]foolish shepherd.',
'11:16': 'For I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not visit those who are perishing, nor seek the scattered, nor heal what is broken, nor sustain what stands, but will devour the flesh of the fat ones and tear off their hooves.',

Zechariah was born of a priestly family in captivity ({Neh12:1|Neh. 12:1}, {Neh12:4|4}, {Neh12:12|12}, {Neh12:16|16}). He was first a priest, and then he became a prophet. He returned to Judah with Zerubbabel at the time of the prophet Haggai in about 520 B.C. ({Ezr5:1|Ezra 5:1}). Zechariah and Haggai encouraged the building of the temple of God under the hands of Zerubbabel and Joshua. Joshua was the high priest, representing the priesthood, and Zerubbabel, a descendant of the royal family, was the governor of Judah, representing the kingship. Thus, the temple of God was built by the kingship with the priesthood. Likewise, in the building up of the church as the Body of Christ, both the priesthood and the kingship are needed ({1Pe2:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5}, {1Pe2:9|9}). See {Ezr5:1^1|note 1<sup>1</sup>} in {Ezr5|Ezra 5}.","The central thought of Zechariah&rsquo;s prophecy is that Jehovah remembers His chastised people and sympathizes with them in their suffering of the nations&rsquo; excessive action in carrying out Jehovah&rsquo;s punishing of Israel. God used the nations to punish Israel, but the nations went too far in carrying out God&rsquo;s punishing of His elect. For Israel&rsquo;s suffering of His punishment, God sent Christ as His Angel to be with them and go with them through their captivity (vv. {Zec1:7|7}-{Zec1:11|11}). He also raised up &ldquo;craftsmen&rdquo; to deal with the nations who had dealt with Israel excessively (vv. {Zec1:20|20}-{Zec1:21|21}). Through Zechariah, a prophet of restoration, God gave His chastised people a hearty word of consolation and promise, saying that He would bring the scattered Israel back to their own country with the expectation of a time of restoration and prosperity (vv. {Zec1:12|12}-{Zec1:17|17}; {Zec2:1|2:1}&mdash;{Zec4:14|4:14}; {Zec6:9|6:9}-{Zec6:15|15}; {Zec8:1|8:1}-{Zec8:23|23}).","In Zechariah&rsquo;s prophecy Christ was sent to Israel as their King in a lowly form ({Zec9:9|9:9}-{Zec9:10|10}) and as their Shepherd to feed them ({Zec11:7|11:7}), but He was detested ({Zec11:8|11:8}), sold ({Zec11:2|11:2}-{Zec11:13|13}), attacked ({Zec13:7|13:7}), and pierced ({Zec12:10|12:10}) and thereby accomplished redemption for them ({Zec13:1|13:1a}; {Zec1:8|1:8}; {Zec3:9|3:9}). Eventually, Christ will fight for Israel to deliver them out of the hand of Antichrist for their household salvation ({Zec12:1|12:1}&mdash;{Zec14:21|14:21}).

This kind of situation allowed Titus, the Roman prince, to devastate the entire country of Judah in A.D. 70 ({Mat21:33|Matt. 21:33}-{Mat21:41|41} and {Mat21:41^1|note 41<sup>1</sup>}).","The center of the prophecies in chs. {Zec9|9}&mdash;{Zec11|11} is Christ as the rejected Messiah. As the coming Savior and Redeemer, Christ came and entered into Jerusalem as the King in a lowly form ({Zec9:9|9:9}-{Zec9:10|10}). At first, He was welcomed by the people, but later, under the influence of the elders, priests, and scribes, they changed their mind and detested Him ({Zec11:8|v. 8b}). The Lord Jesus was sold, judged, sentenced, and put on the cross to die (vv. {Zec11:12|12}-{Zec11:13|13}). Thus, the Messiah, who was welcomed temporarily, was utterly rejected. As a result, the people of Israel were divided, persecuted by the Roman Empire, and scattered throughout the earth (vv. {Zec11:14|14}-{Zec11:17|17})."]},
