'1:1': 'Paul, an [a]apostle of Christ Jesus through the [1]will of God, and [b]Timothy the brother, to the [2c]church of God which is [3]in Corinth, [4]with all the saints who are in the whole of [5d]Achaia:',
'1:2': '[a]Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.',
'1:3': '[a]Blessed be the [b]God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of [1]compassions and God of all [2c]comfort;',
'1:4': 'Who [a]comforts us in all our [b]affliction that we may be [1]able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the [c]comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God.',
'1:5': 'For even as the [1a]sufferings of [2]the Christ abound unto us, so through [2]the Christ our comfort also abounds.',
'1:6': 'But whether we are [a]afflicted, it is for your comforting and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comforting, which operates in the endurance of the same sufferings which we also suffer.',
'1:7': 'And our hope for you is firm, knowing that as you are partakers of the [a]sufferings, so also <I>you</I> <I>are</I> of the comfort.',
'1:8': 'For we do not want you to be [a]ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell <I>us</I> in [b]Asia, that we were excessively [1c]burdened, beyond <I>our</I> power, so that we [2d]despaired even of [3]living.',
'1:9': '[1]Indeed we ourselves had the [2]response of [a]death in ourselves, that we should [b]not base our [c]confidence on ourselves but [d]on [3]God, who [e]raises the dead;',
'1:10': 'Who has [a]delivered us out of so great a death, and [1]will deliver <I>us</I>; in whom we have [b]hoped that He will also yet deliver <I>us</I>,',
'1:11': 'If you also [1]help in <I>this</I> by [a]petition on our behalf, that for the [2]gift to us through many, [b]thanks may be given by many [3]persons on our behalf.',
'1:12': 'For our boasting is this, the testimony of our [1a]conscience, that in [2]singleness and [3b]sincerity of God, not in [4]fleshly [c]wisdom but in the [5d]grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.',
'1:13': 'For no other things do we write to you than what you read or even know; and I hope that you will know unto the end,',
'1:14': 'Even as also you know us [a]in part, that we are your [b]boast, just as you also are [c]ours in the [1d]day of our Lord Jesus.',
'1:15': 'And in this confidence I intended to [a]come to you previously that you might have [1]double [b]grace,',
'1:16': 'And through you to pass through into [1a]Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you and be sent forward by you into [b]Judea.',
'1:17': 'This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose [a]according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no?',
'1:18': '[1]But as God is [a]faithful, our [2b]word toward you is not yes and no.',
'1:19': '[1]For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and [2]Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but <I>our</I> <I>word</I> has become [a]yes in Him.',
'1:20': '[1]For as many [a]promises of God as <I>there</I> <I>are</I>, in [2]Him is the [3]Yes; therefore also through [2]Him is [4]the [b]Amen to God, [5]for [c]glory through [6]us <I>to</I> <I>God</I>.',
'1:21': '[1]But the One who [2]firmly attaches [3]us [4]with you unto [5]Christ and has [6a]anointed us is God,',
'1:22': 'He who has also [1a]sealed us and given the Spirit in our [2]hearts as a [3b]pledge.',
'1:23': 'But I call on God as a [a]witness [1]against my [b]soul that to [2c]spare you I have not yet [d]come to Corinth.',
'1:24': 'Not that we [a]lord it over your faith, but we are fellow workers with <I>you</I> for your joy; for by [1]faith you [b]stand.',
'2:1': 'But I [1]determined this for myself, that I would not [a]come again to you in [b]sorrow.',
'2:2': 'For if I cause you sorrow, who then is the one who makes me glad, except the one who is made sorrowful by me?',
'2:3': 'And I [1a]wrote this very thing <I>to</I> <I>you</I> that when I come I would [b]not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, having [c]confidence in you all that my joy is <I>the</I> <I>joy</I> of you all.',
'2:4': 'For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I [a]wrote to you through many [b]tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the [c]love which I have more abundantly toward you.',
'2:5': 'But if anyone has caused [a]sorrow, he has not caused me to sorrow, but [b]in part (lest I [1]lay <I>too</I> <I>heavy</I> a burden) all of you.',
'2:6': 'Sufficient for such a one is this [a]punishment by the majority,',
'2:7': 'So that on the contrary you should rather [1a]forgive and comfort <I>him</I>, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.',
'2:8': 'Therefore I exhort you to [1]confirm <I>your</I> [a]love toward him.',
'2:9': 'For to this end also I [a]wrote, that I might [1]know your [2]approvedness, whether you are [b]obedient in all things.',
'2:10': 'But whom you [1a]forgive anything, I also [1]<I>forgive</I>; for also what I have [2]forgiven, if I have [2]forgiven anything, <I>it</I> <I>is</I> for your sake in the [3]person of Christ;',
'2:11': 'That we may not be taken advantage of by [1a]Satan, for we are not [b]ignorant of his [2c]schemes.',
'2:12': '[1]Furthermore, when I came to [a]Troas for the gospel of Christ and a [b]door was open to me [2]in the Lord,',
'2:13': 'I had no rest in my [1a]spirit, for I did not find [b]Titus my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into [2c]Macedonia.',
'2:14': 'But [a]thanks be to God, who always [1]leads [2]us in [b]triumph in [3]the Christ and manifests the [4c]savor of the [d]knowledge of Him through [5]us in every place.',
'2:15': 'For we [1]are a [a]fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being [b]saved and in those who are [c]perishing:',
'2:16': 'To some a [a]savor out of death [1]unto [b]death, and to the others a savor out of life [1]unto [c]life. And who is [2d]sufficient for these things?',
'2:17': 'For we are not like the many, [1a]adulterating the word of God for profit; but as out of [b]sincerity, but as out of God, before God we [2]speak in Christ.',
'3:1': 'Are we beginning again to [a]commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, [b]letters of commendation to you or from you?',
'3:2': 'You are [1]our [a]letter, inscribed in [2]our hearts, known and read by all men,',
'3:3': 'Since you are being manifested that you are a [1]letter of Christ [2]ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but [3]with the [a]Spirit of the [b]living God; not in [c]tablets of stone but in tablets of [4d]hearts of flesh.',
'3:4': 'And such [a]confidence we have through Christ toward God,',
'3:5': 'Not that we are [1a]sufficient of ourselves to [2]account anything as from ourselves; but our [3]sufficiency is [b]from God,',
'3:6': 'Who has also made us [a]sufficient as [b]ministers of a [c]new covenant, <I>ministers</I> not of the [1]letter but of the [2d]Spirit; for the [3]letter kills, but the [4e]Spirit gives life.',
'3:7': 'Moreover if the [1]ministry of [a]death, engraved in [b]stone in letters, came about in [2c]glory, so that the sons of Israel were not able to gaze at the face of Moses because of the glory of his face, <I>a</I> <I>glory</I> which was being done away with,',
'3:8': 'How shall the [1a]ministry of the [b]Spirit not be more in [2]glory?',
'3:9': 'For if there is glory with the ministry of [1a]condemnation, much more the ministry of [2b]righteousness [3]abounds with glory.',
'3:10': 'For also that which has been [1]glorified [2]in this respect [3]has not been glorified on account of the surpassing glory.',
'3:11': 'For if that which was [1]being done away with was [2]through [a]glory, much more that which remains is in [b]glory.',
'3:12': 'Therefore since we have such [1]hope, we use much [2a]boldness,',
'3:13': 'And <I>are</I> not like Moses, <I>who</I> put a [a]veil on his face so that the sons of Israel would not gaze [1]at the end of that which was being done away with.',
'3:14': 'But their [1a]thoughts were [b]hardened; for until the present day the same veil remains at the [c]reading of the old covenant, [2]it not being unveiled <I>to</I> <I>them</I> that <I>the</I> <I>veil</I> is being done away with in Christ.',
'3:15': 'Indeed unto this day, whenever [1]Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart;',
'3:16': 'But whenever [1]<I>their</I> <I>heart</I> turns to the Lord, the [a]veil is taken away.',
'3:17': '[1]And the [2]Lord is the [3a]Spirit; and where the [4b]Spirit of the Lord is, there is [5c]freedom.',
'3:18': '[1]But [2]we all with [3]unveiled face, [4a]beholding and reflecting like a [5b]mirror the [6c]glory of the Lord, are [7]being [d]transformed into the [8]same [e]image [9]from glory to [f]glory, even as [10]from the [11]Lord Spirit.',
'4:1': '[1]Therefore having [2]this [a]ministry as we have been shown [3b]mercy, we do [c]not lose heart;',
'4:2': 'But we have renounced the hidden things of [a]shame, not walking in [b]craftiness nor [1c]adulterating the word of God, but by the manifestation of the [2d]truth [e]commending ourselves to every [f]conscience of men before God.',
'4:3': 'And even if our gospel is [1]veiled, it is [a]veiled in those who are [b]perishing,',
'4:4': 'In whom the [1a]god of [b]this age has [2c]blinded the [3d]thoughts of the unbelievers that the [4e]illumination of the gospel of the [f]glory of Christ, who is the [g]image of God, might not [5]shine <I>on</I> <I>them</I>.',
'4:5': '[1]For we do not [a]preach ourselves but Christ Jesus as [2b]Lord, and ourselves as your [3c]slaves for Jesus&rsquo; sake.',
'4:6': '[1]Because the God who said, Out of [a]darkness [b]light shall shine, is the One who shined [2]in [3]our [c]hearts to [4d]illuminate the knowledge of the [e]glory of God in the [5]face of Jesus Christ.',
'4:7': '[1]But we have this [2a]treasure in earthen [b]vessels that the [3c]excellency of the [d]power may be of God and not out of us.',
'4:8': '<I>We</I> <I>are</I> [1]pressed on [a]every side but not [2]constricted; unable to find a way out but not [b]utterly without a way out;',
'4:9': '[1a]Persecuted but not [2b]abandoned; [3]cast down but [c]not [4]destroyed;',
'4:10': 'Always bearing about [a]in the body the [1b]putting to [c]death of Jesus [2]that the [3]life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.',
'4:11': 'For we who are alive are always being delivered unto [a]death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the [b]life of [1]Jesus also may be manifested in our [c]mortal [2]flesh.',
'4:12': 'So then [a]death operates in us, but [1]life in you.',
'4:13': 'And having the [1]same [2a]spirit of [b]faith according to that which is written, [c]&ldquo;I believed, therefore I spoke,&rdquo; we also believe, therefore we also speak,',
'4:14': 'Knowing that He who [a]raised the Lord Jesus will [1b]raise us also with Jesus and will [c]make <I>us</I> stand before <I>Him</I> with you.',
'4:15': 'For [a]all things are [b]for your sakes that the [1c]grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the [d]thanksgiving to abound to the [e]glory of God.',
'4:16': 'Therefore we do [a]not lose heart; but though our [1b]outer man is [2]decaying, yet our [1c]inner <I>man</I> is being [3d]renewed day by day.',
'4:17': 'For our [a]momentary lightness of [1]affliction works out for us, [2]more and more surpassingly, an [3]eternal weight of [4b]glory,',
'4:18': 'Because we do not regard the [1]things which are [a]seen but the [2]things which are [b]not seen; for the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are [c]eternal.',
'5:1': '[1]For we know that if our [2]earthly [3a]tabernacle dwelling is taken down, we have a [4]building [5]from God, a [6]dwelling [b]not made with hands, [c]eternal, [7d]in the heavens.',
'5:2': 'For also in [1]this we [a]groan, longing to be [2]clothed upon with our [3]dwelling place [4]from heaven,',
'5:3': 'If indeed, being clothed, we will not be found [1a]naked.',
'5:4': 'For also, we who are in this tabernacle groan, being [1a]burdened, [2]in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that [3]what is [b]mortal may be [4c]swallowed up by life.',
'5:5': 'Now He who has [1]wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the Spirit as a [2a]pledge.',
'5:6': 'Therefore being always of good courage and knowing that while we are [1]at home in the body, we are [1]abroad from the Lord',
'5:7': '(For we [1]walk by [a]faith, not by [2b]appearance)&mdash;',
'5:8': 'We are of good courage then and are well pleased rather [1]to be [a]abroad from the body and at home with the Lord.',
'5:9': 'Therefore also we are [1]determined, whether [2]at home or abroad, to gain the honor of being [a]well pleasing to Him.',
'5:10': '[1]For we must all be [a]manifested before the [2b]judgment seat of Christ, that each one may [3c]receive the things <I>done</I> [4]through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or [5]bad.',
'5:11': '[1]Knowing therefore the [2a]fear of the Lord, we [3]persuade men, but we are made manifest to God; yet I hope that we are made manifest also in your [b]consciences.',
'5:12': 'We are not again [a]commending ourselves to you, but <I>so</I> <I>speak</I> in order to give you an opportunity to [b]boast on our behalf, that you may [1]have <I>an</I> <I>answer</I> for those who are [c]boasting in [d]outward [2]appearance and not in [3e]heart.',
'5:13': 'For whether we were [1a]beside ourselves, <I>it</I> <I>was</I> to God; or whether we are [2b]sober-minded, <I>it</I> <I>is</I> [c]for you.',
'5:14': 'For the [1a]love of Christ [2]constrains us because we [3]have judged this, that [4b]One died for all, [5]therefore [c]all died;',
'5:15': 'And He [a]died for all that those who [b]live may [1]no longer live to themselves but [2c]to Him who died for them and has been raised.',
'5:16': '[1]So then we, from now on, [2]know no one according to the [a]flesh; even though we have [2]known Christ [b]according to the flesh, yet now we [2]know <I>Him</I> <I>so</I> no longer.',
'5:17': '[1]So then if anyone is [2a]in Christ, <I>he</I> <I>is</I> a [3b]new creation. The [4c]old things have [d]passed away; [5]behold, [6]they have become [e]new.',
'5:18': 'But [1]all things are out from God, who has [a]reconciled us to Himself through Christ and has given to us the [b]ministry of reconciliation;',
'5:19': 'Namely, that God [a]in Christ was reconciling the [b]world to Himself, [c]not accounting their offenses to them, and has put in us the [1]word of reconciliation.',
'5:20': 'On behalf of Christ then we are [1a]ambassadors, as God [b]entreats <I>you</I> through us; we beseech <I>you</I> on behalf of Christ, Be [2]reconciled to God.',
'5:21': 'Him who did [1]not know sin He made [2a]sin on our behalf that we might become the [3b]righteousness of God [4]in Him.',
'6:1': '[1]And working [2]together with <I>Him</I>, we also [3a]entreat you not to receive the [4b]grace of God in vain;',
'6:2': 'For He says, [a]&ldquo;In an [b]acceptable time I listened to you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.&rdquo; Behold, now is the [1]well-[c]acceptable time; behold, now is the [d]day of [2]salvation.',
'6:3': '[1]We give no occasion of stumbling in anything that the [2]ministry may not be faulted,',
'6:4': 'But in everything we [a]commend ourselves as [b]ministers of God, in much [1c]endurance, in [d]afflictions, in [2e]necessities, in [f]distresses,',
'6:5': 'In [a]stripes, in [b]imprisonments, in [c]tumults, in [d]labors, in [1e]watchings, in [2]fastings;',
'6:6': 'In pureness, in [1a]knowledge, in long-suffering, in kindness, in a [b]holy [2]spirit, in [c]unfeigned [1]love,',
'6:7': 'In the [a]word of truth, in the [b]power of God; through the [1c]weapons of righteousness [2]on the right and on the left,',
'6:8': 'Through [1]glory and [a]dishonor, through [2b]evil report and good report; as [3c]deceivers and yet [d]true;',
'6:9': 'As [1]unknown and yet well known; as [2a]dying and yet behold we [b]live; as [3]being disciplined and yet [c]not being put to death;',
'6:10': 'As [1]made [a]sorrowful yet always [b]rejoicing; as [2]poor yet [c]enriching many; as [3d]having nothing and yet possessing [e]all things.',
'6:11': 'Our mouth is [1a]opened to you, Corinthians; our heart is [1b]enlarged.',
'6:12': 'You are not constricted in us, but you are [1]constricted in your [2a]inward parts.',
'6:13': 'But for a [1]recompense in kind, I speak as to [2a]children, you also [3]be enlarged.',
'6:14': '[1]Do not become [2a]dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers. For what [3b]partnership do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what [c]fellowship does [d]light have [4]with [e]darkness?',
'6:15': 'And what concord does [a]Christ have [1]with Belial? Or what part does a believer have with an [b]unbeliever?',
'6:16': 'And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the [a]temple of the [1b]living God, even as God said, [c]&ldquo;I will dwell among them and walk among <I>them</I>; and [d]I will be their God, and they will be My people.&rdquo;',
'6:17': 'Therefore [a]&ldquo;come out from their midst and be [1]separated, says the Lord, and do not touch [2]what is [b]unclean; and I will [3]welcome you&rdquo;;',
'6:18': '&ldquo;And I will be [1]a [a]Father to you, and you will be [2b]sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty.&rdquo;',
'7:1': '[1]Therefore since we have [2]these promises, beloved, let us [a]cleanse ourselves from all [3]defilement of flesh and of [b]spirit, [4]perfecting [c]holiness in the [5d]fear of God.',
'7:2': '[1a]Make room for us; we have [2b]wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken [c]advantage of no one.',
'7:3': 'I do not say <I>this</I> to condemn <I>you</I>, for I have said before that you are [1]in our hearts for <I>our</I> dying together and <I>our</I> living together.',
'7:4': 'Great is my [a]boldness toward you, great is my [b]boasting on your behalf; I am filled with [1c]comfort, I overflow with [1d]joy in all our [e]affliction.',
'7:5': 'For even when we came into [a]Macedonia, our [1]flesh had no rest, but <I>we</I> <I>were</I> [b]afflicted in everything; without were [c]fightings, within were fears.',
'7:6': 'But He who [a]comforts those who are [1]downcast, <I>that</I> <I>is</I>, God, [2b]comforted us by the [3]coming of [c]Titus;',
'7:7': 'And not only by his coming, but also by the comfort with which he was comforted because of you, declaring to us your [a]longing, your lamentation, your [b]zeal for me, so that I [c]rejoiced the more.',
'7:8': 'For though I caused you [a]sorrow by the [1]letter, I do not regret <I>it</I>. Even if I [2]did regret <I>it</I> (for I see that that letter, even if for an hour, [3]caused you sorrow),',
'7:9': 'Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to [1]repentance; for you were made [2a]sorrowful according to God, that in nothing you might suffer loss from us.',
'7:10': 'For sorrow according to God works [a]repentance unto [1]salvation, <I>which</I> <I>is</I> without regret; but the [b]sorrow of the world works out death.',
'7:11': 'For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what [1a]earnestness it has [2]worked out in you, [3]indeed <I>what</I> [4]defense, indeed <I>what</I> [5]indignation, indeed <I>what</I> [6]fear, indeed <I>what</I> [7b]longing, indeed <I>what</I> [8c]zeal, indeed <I>what</I> [9d]punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in [10]the matter.',
'7:12': 'So then, though I [a]wrote to you, <I>it</I> <I>was</I> not for the sake of [1]him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of [2]him who was wronged, but for the sake of [3]manifesting to you before God your earnestness for us.',
'7:13': 'Because of this we have been [a]comforted. And in addition to our comfort, we [b]rejoiced [1]more abundantly over the joy of [2]Titus, because his [3]spirit has been [c]refreshed by all of you.',
'7:14': 'For if in anything I [a]boasted to him on your behalf, I have not been put to shame; on the contrary, as we spoke all things in truth to you, so also our boasting before Titus turned out to be the truth.',
'7:15': 'And his [1]affections are abundantly toward you, he remembering the [a]obedience of you all, how you received him with [b]fear and trembling.',
'7:16': 'I [a]rejoice that in everything I [1]have boldness because of you.',
'8:1': 'Furthermore we make known to you, brothers, the [1a]grace of God which has been given in the churches of [b]Macedonia,',
'8:2': 'That in much [1]proving of affliction the abundance of their joy and the depth of their [a]poverty abounded unto the riches of their [2b]liberality;',
'8:3': 'That according to <I>their</I> power, I testify, and beyond <I>their</I> power, [a]of their own accord,',
'8:4': 'With much entreaty they besought of us the [1]grace and the fellowship of the [a]ministry to the saints;',
'8:5': 'And <I>this</I>, not as we had hoped, but they [a]gave themselves [1]first to the Lord, [2]and to us [3]through the will of God.',
'8:6': 'So we entreated [a]Titus that, even as he began before, so also he would complete for you this [1b]grace [2]as well.',
'8:7': 'But just as you [a]abound in everything, in faith and in [1]word and in [b]knowledge and in all [2c]earnestness and in [3]the love in you [4]from us, abound in this [5]grace also.',
'8:8': 'I am [a]not speaking by way of command but through the earnestness of others, proving also the genuineness of your love.',
'8:9': 'For you know the [1a]grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, for your sakes He became poor in order that you, because of His poverty, might become [b]rich.',
'8:10': 'And I give <I>my</I> [1a]opinion in this matter, for this is profitable for you who were the first to begin [b]a year ago not only to do <I>this</I> but even to intend to do <I>this</I>.',
'8:11': 'But now complete also the doing, so that as <I>there</I> <I>was</I> the [a]eagerness in intending, so also <I>there</I> <I>would</I> <I>be</I> the completing out of what you [b]have.',
'8:12': 'For if the eagerness is there, it is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have.',
'8:13': 'For <I>it</I> <I>is</I> not that to others <I>there</I> <I>would</I> <I>be</I> relief, <I>yet</I> to you affliction,',
'8:14': 'But <I>it</I> <I>is</I> out of equality; at the present time your abundance for their [a]lack that their abundance also may be for your lack, so that there may be equality;',
'8:15': 'As it is written, [1a]&ldquo;He who <I>gathered</I> much had no excess, and he who <I>gathered</I> little had no lack.&rdquo;',
'8:16': 'But [a]thanks be to God who puts the same [1b]earnestness on your behalf in the heart of [c]Titus,',
'8:17': 'Because he not only received the [1a]entreaty, but being more earnest, he also went forth [b]of his own accord to you.',
'8:18': 'And we sent together with him the [a]brother whose praise in the gospel is throughout [b]all the churches,',
'8:19': 'And not only <I>this</I>, but who has also been selected by the churches as our fellow traveler in this [1a]grace which is being ministered by us, to the [b]glory of the Lord Himself and <I>to</I> <I>demonstrate</I> <I>our</I> [c]eagerness;',
'8:20': '[1]Avoiding this, that anyone should find fault with us in this [2]abundance which is being ministered by us.',
'8:21': 'For we [1]exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.',
'8:22': 'And we sent with them [1]our brother, whom we have proved to be [2]diligent in many things many times, yet now much more [2]diligent because of the great [a]confidence <I>he</I> <I>has</I> toward you.',
'8:23': 'Whether concerning [a]Titus, <I>he</I> <I>is</I> my [b]partner and [c]fellow worker for you; or our brothers, <I>they</I> <I>are</I> [1]apostles of the churches, <I>they</I> <I>are</I> Christ&rsquo;s glory.',
'8:24': 'Show therefore to them, in the face of the churches, the proof of your love and of our [a]boasting on your behalf.',
'9:1': 'For concerning the [a]ministry to the saints, it is superfluous for me to [b]write to you;',
'9:2': 'For I know your [a]eagerness, of which I [b]boast on your behalf to the Macedonians, that [1]Achaia has been prepared since [c]last year; and your zeal has stirred up the greater number <I>of</I> <I>them</I>.',
'9:3': 'But I sent the [a]brothers that our boasting on your behalf might not be made void in this respect, that, as I said, you might be prepared;',
'9:4': 'Lest, if the [a]Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, be put to shame in this [1b]confidence.',
'9:5': 'Therefore I thought it necessary to entreat the brothers to go before to you and make ready beforehand your previously promised [1a]blessing, that thus this might be ready [2]as a blessing and not [2]as <I>a</I> <I>matter</I> <I>of</I> covetousness.',
'9:6': 'But <I>take</I> <I>note</I> <I>of</I> this: He who [a]sows sparingly shall also sparingly reap; and he who sows with [1]blessings shall also with [2]blessings reap;',
'9:7': 'Each one as he has purposed in his heart, [a]not out of sorrow or out of [1]necessity, for [2]God loves a [3]cheerful giver.',
'9:8': 'And God is able to make [1]all grace abound unto you, that, in everything always having all sufficiency, you may [a]abound unto every good work;',
'9:9': 'Even as it is written, [a]&ldquo;He has [1b]scattered abroad; he has given to the [2c]poor; his [3]righteousness abides forever.&rdquo;',
'9:10': 'Now [1]He who bountifully supplies [a]seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed and cause the fruits of your righteousness to increase.',
'9:11': 'You in everything are being [a]enriched unto all [1]liberality, which works out through us [b]thanksgiving to God,',
'9:12': 'Because the [a]ministry of this [1]service is not only filling up the [b]lack of the saints, but is also abounding through many thanksgivings to God.',
'9:13': 'They, through the [1]approving of this ministry, are [a]glorifying God <I>based</I> upon the subjection unto the gospel of Christ that <I>issues</I> from your [b]confession, and upon the [c]liberality of the [2d]fellowship to them and to all;',
'9:14': 'While in petition on your behalf they also long after you on account of the [1]surpassing [2]grace of God upon you.',
'9:15': '[a]Thanks be to God for His [1]indescribable [2b]gift!',
'10:1': '[1]But I myself, Paul, [a]entreat you through the [2b]meekness and [3]gentleness of Christ, who <I>(as</I> <I>you</I> <I>say</I>) in [c]person am [4d]base among you, but while absent am [5e]bold toward you,',
'10:2': 'I beseech <I>you</I> that when [a]present I would not have to be [b]bold in the confidence with which I count myself, to dare do to some who count us as ones who are walking [c]according to flesh.',
'10:3': 'For though we walk [1]in flesh, we do not [a]war according to flesh;',
'10:4': 'For the [a]weapons of our [b]warfare are [1]not fleshly but [2c]powerful before God for the [d]overthrowing of strongholds,',
'10:5': 'As we overthrow [1a]reasonings and every [2b]high thing rising up against the knowledge of God, and take [c]captive every [1d]thought unto the [e]obedience of Christ.',
'10:6': 'And we are ready to [1a]punish all disobedience when your [2b]obedience is fulfilled.',
'10:7': 'You look at things [a]according to <I>their</I> appearance. If someone [1]has confidence in himself to be [b]of Christ, let him take account of this again concerning himself, that even as he is [c]of Christ, [d]so also are we.',
'10:8': 'For even if I should [a]boast somewhat more abundantly concerning our [b]authority, which the Lord has given for [1c]building <I>you</I> up and not for overthrowing you, I will not be put to shame.',
'10:9': 'I say this so as not to seem as if I am terrifying you through my letters,',
'10:10': 'Because while his letters, <I>someone</I> says, are weighty and strong, his [a]bodily presence is [1b]weak and his [c]speech [2]contemptible.',
'10:11': 'Let such a one take account of this, that such as we are in word by letters when absent, such also <I>we</I> <I>are</I> in deed when present.',
'10:12': 'For we do not [a]dare to class or compare ourselves with any of those who [b]commend themselves; but they, measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.',
'10:13': 'But we will [1]not [a]boast beyond <I>our</I> measure but [2]according to the measure of the [3]rule which the God of measure has [b]apportioned to us, to reach even as far as you.',
'10:14': 'For we are not [1]extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you, for we were the first to [a]come even as far as unto you in the [b]gospel of Christ.',
'10:15': '<I>We</I> <I>are</I> [a]not boasting beyond <I>our</I> measure in [b]others&rsquo; labors, but have the hope, as your faith is increasing, to be [1]magnified in you according to our rule unto abundance,',
'10:16': 'So that we may announce the gospel unto those parts beyond you, not so that we may boast in another man&rsquo;s rule in things <I>already</I> prepared.',
'10:17': 'But he who [a]boasts, let him boast in the Lord;',
'10:18': 'For <I>it</I> <I>is</I> not the one who [a]commends himself who is [b]approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.',
'11:1': 'I wish that you would [a]bear with me in a little [1b]foolishness; but indeed you do bear with me.',
'11:2': 'For I am jealous over you with a [1a]jealousy of God; for I [b]betrothed you to one husband to [c]present <I>you</I> <I>as</I> a pure [2d]virgin to Christ.',
'11:3': 'But I fear lest somehow, as the [a]serpent [b]deceived [c]Eve by his [d]craftiness, your [1e]thoughts would be corrupted from the [2f]simplicity and the [g]purity toward Christ.',
'11:4': 'For if indeed he who comes preaches [1a]another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or you receive a [1b]different spirit, which you have not received, or a [1c]different gospel, which you have not accepted, you [d]bear [2]well with <I>him</I>.',
'11:5': 'But I count myself to be inferior to the [1a]super-apostles in nothing.',
'11:6': 'But even if I am a [1]layman in [a]speech, yet I am not in [b]knowledge; indeed in every way we have made <I>this</I> [c]manifest in all things to you.',
'11:7': 'Or did I commit a sin, abasing myself that you might be exalted, because I announced the gospel of God to you [a]free of charge?',
'11:8': 'I robbed other churches, taking wages for the ministry to you.',
'11:9': 'And when I was present with you and [a]lacked, I was not a [b]burden to anyone; for the brothers who came from [c]Macedonia [d]filled up my lack, and in everything I kept myself from being [e]burdensome to you, and will keep <I>myself</I>.',
'11:10': 'The [1]truthfulness of Christ is in me, that this [a]boasting shall not be stopped as it regards me in the regions of [b]Achaia.',
'11:11': 'Why? Because I do not [a]love you? God [b]knows.',
'11:12': 'But what I do, I also will do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those desiring an opportunity, that in the thing in which they boast, they may be found even as we.',
'11:13': 'For such ones are [1a]false apostles, deceitful [b]workers, [2]transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.',
'11:14': 'And no wonder, for [1a]Satan himself transfigures himself into an [2b]angel of light.',
'11:15': 'Therefore it is no great thing if also his ministers transfigure themselves into [1]ministers of righteousness, whose [a]end will be according to their works.',
'11:16': 'Again I say, Let no one think me to be [a]foolish; but if otherwise, accept me even as if I were foolish, that I also may [b]boast a little.',
'11:17': 'What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord but as if in [a]foolishness, in this [1b]confidence of boasting.',
'11:18': 'Since many [a]boast according to the [b]flesh, I also will [c]boast.',
'11:19': 'For you [a]bear gladly with [b]fools because you <I>yourselves</I> are [1]wise.',
'11:20': 'For you bear <I>it</I> if anyone [a]enslaves you, if anyone [b]devours <I>you</I>, if anyone [1]takes <I>you</I>, if anyone [c]lifts himself up, if anyone beats you in the face.',
'11:21': '[1]By way of self-disparagement I say <I>this</I>, [2]Supposedly we ourselves were [a]weak. But in whatever anyone <I>else</I> is daring, I speak in [b]foolishness, I also am [c]daring.',
'11:22': '[1a]Hebrews are they? I also. [1b]Israelites are they? I also. The [1c]seed of Abraham are they? I also.',
'11:23': '[a]Ministers of Christ are they? I speak as being [1b]beside myself, I more so! In [c]labors more abundantly, in [d]imprisonments more abundantly, in [e]stripes [2]excessively, in [f]deaths often.',
'11:24': 'Under <I>the</I> <I>hands</I> <I>of</I> the Jews five times I received [a]forty <I>stripes</I> less one;',
'11:25': 'Three times I was beaten with [1]rods, once I was [a]stoned, [2]three times I was [b]shipwrecked, a night and a day I have spent in the deep;',
'11:26': 'In journeys often, in dangers of [1]rivers, in dangers of [2]robbers, in dangers from <I>my</I> [a]race, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the [b]city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among [3c]false brothers;',
'11:27': 'In [a]labor and hardship; in [1]watchings often; in [2b]hunger and thirst; in [2c]fastings often; in [3]cold and [4d]nakedness&mdash;',
'11:28': 'Apart from the things which <I>have</I> [1]not <I>been</I> <I>mentioned</I>, <I>there</I> <I>is</I> <I>this</I>: the crowd <I>of</I> <I>cares</I> pressing upon me daily, the [2]anxious concern for [a]all the churches.',
'11:29': 'Who is [a]weak, and I am not weak? Who is [b]stumbled, and [1]I myself do not [2]burn?',
'11:30': 'If I must [a]boast, I will boast of the [1]things of my [b]weakness.',
'11:31': 'The [a]God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is [b]blessed forever, [c]knows that I am [d]not lying.',
'11:32': 'In [a]Damascus, the [1]governor under Aretas the king [b]guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me;',
'11:33': 'And in a basket I was [a]lowered through a window, through the wall, and escaped his hands.',
'12:1': 'To [a]boast is [1]necessary, <I>though</I> indeed not [b]expedient; yet I will [2]come to [3c]visions and [d]revelations of the Lord.',
'12:2': 'I know a [1]man [a]in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God [b]knows) such a one was [2]caught away [3]to the [4]third heaven.',
'12:3': '[1]And I know such a man (whether in the body or [2]outside the body, I do not know; God knows),',
'12:4': 'That he was caught away into [1]Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is [a]not allowed for a man to speak.',
'12:5': 'On behalf of such a one I will [a]boast, but on behalf of myself I will not [b]boast, except in my [c]weaknesses.',
'12:6': 'For if I desire to [a]boast, I will not be foolish, for I will [b]speak the truth; but I refrain lest anyone account of me <I>something</I> above what he [c]sees me <I>to</I> <I>be</I> or [d]hears from me.',
'12:7': 'And because of the [1]transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly [a]lifted up, there was given to me a [2b]thorn in the flesh, a messenger of [c]Satan, that he might [3]buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up.',
'12:8': 'Concerning this I entreated the Lord [a]three times that it might depart from me.',
'12:9': 'And He has said to me, My [1a]grace is sufficient for you, for My [2b]power is perfected in [c]weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the [d]power of Christ might [3e]tabernacle over me.',
'12:10': 'Therefore I am [1]well pleased in [a]weaknesses, in [2]insults, in [3b]necessities, in [c]persecutions and [4d]distresses, on behalf of Christ; for when I am [5e]weak, then I am [5]powerful.',
'12:11': 'I have become [a]foolish; you yourselves have compelled me. For <I>it</I> <I>is</I> I <I>who</I> should have been [b]commended by you; for in nothing am I inferior to the [1c]super-apostles, even though I am [d]nothing.',
'12:12': 'Indeed the [1]signs of an [a]apostle were wrought among you in all [b]endurance by [2c]signs and [3]wonders and [4]works of power.',
'12:13': 'For what is there in which you were [1]treated in a manner inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself was not a [a]burden to you? [2]Graciously forgive me this [2]injustice!',
'12:14': 'Behold, this [a]third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden; for I do [b]not seek what is yours but you. For the [c]children ought not to store up for the parents, but the [d]parents for the children.',
'12:15': 'But I, I will most gladly [1]spend and [2a]be utterly spent on behalf of your souls. If I [b]love you more abundantly, am I loved less?',
'12:16': 'But [1]let it be <I>so</I>! I did [a]not burden you; but, <I>as</I> <I>some</I> <I>of</I> <I>you</I> <I>say</I>, being [2]crafty, I took you by guile.',
'12:17': 'Did I take [a]advantage of you through anyone whom I have sent [b]to you?',
'12:18': 'I entreated [a]Titus and sent with <I>him</I> the [b]brother. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not walk in the same [1c]spirit? In the same [d]steps?',
'12:19': 'All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. [1a]Before God [b]in Christ we speak; but all things, beloved, <I>are</I> for your [c]building up.',
'12:20': 'For I [a]fear that perhaps when I come, I may find you not such as I wish, and I may be found by you not such as you wish; that perhaps <I>there</I> <I>may</I> <I>be</I> [1b]strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, [c]selfish ambitions, [2]slanders, [3]whisperings, [4]demonstrations of being puffed up, [5d]tumults;',
'12:21': 'That when I come again my God may humble me before you and I may mourn over many who have [a]sinned before and who have not [b]repented of the [c]uncleanness and [d]fornication and licentiousness which they have practiced.',
'13:1': 'This [a]third time I am coming to you; at the mouth of two or three [b]witnesses shall every word be established.',
'13:2': 'I have previously said and I say beforehand, when I was present the second time and being [a]absent now, to those who have [b]sinned before and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will [c]not spare,',
'13:3': 'Since you seek a proof of the Christ who is speaking in me, who is not weak unto you but is [1a]powerful in you.',
'13:4': 'For indeed He was [a]crucified out of [1]weakness, but He [b]lives [2]by the power of God. For indeed [3]we are [c]weak in Him, but we will [d]live together with Him [2]by the [e]power of God <I>directed</I> toward you.',
'13:5': 'Test yourselves whether you are in the [1]faith; [2]prove yourselves. Or do you not realize about yourselves that [3]Jesus Christ is [a]in you, unless you are [4b]disapproved?',
'13:6': 'But I hope that you will know that [1]we are not disapproved.',
'13:7': 'Now we pray to God that you do nothing wrong, [1]not that we may appear approved, but that you yourselves may do what is good and we may be as if disapproved.',
'13:8': '[1]For we are not able <I>to</I> <I>do</I> anything against the [2]truth but <I>rather</I> for the truth.',
'13:9': 'For we rejoice whenever we are [1a]weak and you are powerful; this also we pray for, your [2b]perfecting.',
'13:10': 'Therefore I write these things while being [a]absent in order that when [b]present I would not <I>have</I> <I>to</I> use [c]severity, according to the [d]authority which the Lord has given me for [e]building up and not for overthrowing.',
'13:11': 'Finally, brothers, [1a]rejoice, be [2]perfected, be [3]comforted, [4b]think the same thing, be [5]at [c]peace; and the [d]God of [6]love and peace will be with you.',
'13:12': 'Greet one another with a [1a]holy kiss.',
'13:13': '[a]All the saints greet you.',
'13:14': 'The [1a]grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the [b]love of God and the [c]fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.',

In the second, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are developed further, but the gifts are not even mentioned. The gifts are replaced in this book by the ministry, which is constituted with, and produced and formed by, the experiences of the riches of Christ gained through sufferings, consuming pressures, and the killing work of the cross. This Epistle gives us a pattern, an example, of how the killing of the cross works, how Christ is wrought into our being, and how we become the expression of Christ. These processes constitute the ministers of Christ and produce the ministry for God&rsquo;s new covenant. The first Epistle deals negatively with the gifts; the second speaks positively about the ministry. The church needs the ministry much more than the gifts. The ministry is for ministering the Christ whom we have experienced, whereas the gifts are just for teaching the doctrines concerning Christ.

This clearly indicates that two steps are required for men to be fully reconciled to God. The first step is to reconcile sinners to God from sin. For this purpose Christ died for our sins ({1Co15:3|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:3}) that they might be forgiven by God. This is the objective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He bore our sins on the cross that they might be judged by God upon Him for us. The second step is to reconcile believers living in the natural life to God from the flesh. For this purpose Christ died for us&mdash;the persons&mdash;that we might live to Him in the resurrection life (vv. {2Co5:14|14}-{2Co5:15|15}). This is the subjective aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death. In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. By the two aspects of His death He has fully reconciled God&rsquo;s chosen people to God. These two steps of reconciliation are clearly portrayed by the two veils of the tabernacle. The first veil is called &ldquo;the screen&rdquo; ({Exo26:37|Exo. 26:37}). A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing this screen. This typifies the first step of reconciliation. The second veil ({Exo26:31|Exo. 26:31}-{Exo26:35|35}; {Heb9:3|Heb. 9:3}) still separated him from God, who was in the Holy of Holies. This veil needed to be rent that the sinner might be brought to God in the Holy of Holies. This is the second step of reconciliation. The Corinthian believers had been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place. Yet they still lived in the flesh. They needed to pass the second veil, which had been rent already ({Mat27:51|Matt. 27:51}; {Heb10:20|Heb. 10:20}), to enter into the Holy of Holies to live with God in their spirit ({1Co6:17|1&nbsp;Cor. 6:17}). The goal of this Epistle was to bring them there that they might be persons in the spirit ({1Co2:15|1&nbsp;Cor. 2:15}), in the Holy of Holies.

{sup:"1a", word:"grace", vrefs:"Rom. 16:20; 1&nbsp;Cor. 16:23; Gal. 6:18; Rev. 22:21", lines:["The grace of the Lord is the Lord Himself as life to us for our enjoyment ({Joh1:17|John 1:17} and {Joh1:17^1|note 1}; {1Co15:10|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:10} and {1Co15:10^1|note 1}), the love of God is God Himself ({1Jo4:8|1&nbsp;John 4:8}, {1Jo4:16|16}) as the source of the grace of the Lord, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the transmission of the grace of the Lord with the love of God for our participation. These are not three separate matters but three aspects of one thing, just as the Lord, God, and the Holy Spirit are not three separate Gods but three &ldquo;hypostases&mdash;of the one same undivided and indivisible&rdquo; God (Philip Schaff). The Greek word for hypostasis (used in {Heb11:1|Heb. 11:1}&mdash;see {Heb11:1^2|note 2} there), the singular form of hypostases, refers to a support under, a support beneath, i.e., something underneath that supports, a supporting substance. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead.","The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, with Their divine virtues. Here the grace of the Lord is mentioned first because this book is on the grace of Christ ({2Co1:12|1:12}; {2Co4:15|4:15}; {2Co6:1|6:1}; {2Co8:1|8:1}, {2Co8:9|9}; {2Co9:8|9:8}, {2Co9:14|14}; {2Co12:9|12:9}). Such a divine attribute of three virtues&mdash;love, grace, and fellowship&mdash;and such a Triune God of the three divine hypostases&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;were needed by the distracted and confused yet comforted and restored Corinthian believers. Hence, the apostle used all these divine and precious things in one sentence to conclude his lovely and dear Epistle.","This verse is strong proof that the trinity of the Godhead is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology but for the dispensing of God Himself in His trinity into His chosen and redeemed people. In the Bible the Trinity is never revealed merely as a doctrine. It is always revealed or mentioned in regard to the relationship of God with His creatures, especially with man, who was created by Him, and more particularly with His chosen and redeemed people. The first divine title used in the divine revelation, Elohim in Hebrew, a title used in relation to God&rsquo;s creation, is plural in number ({Gen1:1|Gen. 1:1}), implying that God, as the Creator of the heavens and the earth for man, is triune. Concerning His creation of man in His own image, after His own likeness, He used the plural pronouns Us and Our, referring to His trinity ({Gen1:26|Gen. 1:26}) and implying that He would be one with man and express Himself through man in His trinity. Later, in {Gen3:22|Gen. 3:22} and {Gen11:7|11:7} and {Isa6:8|Isa. 6:8}, He referred to Himself again and again as Us in regard to His relationship with man and with His chosen people.","In order to redeem fallen man that He might again have the position to be one with man, He became incarnated ({Joh1:1|John 1:1}, {Joh1:14|14}) in the Son and through the Spirit ({Luk1:31|Luke 1:31}-{Luk1:35|35}) to be a man, and lived a human life on the earth, also in the Son ({Luk2:49|Luke 2:49}) and by the Spirit ({Luk4:1|Luke 4:1}; {Mat12:28|Matt. 12:28}). At the beginning of the Son&rsquo;s ministry on the earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit ({Mat3:16|Matt. 3:16}-{Mat3:17|17}; {Luk4:18|Luke 4:18}) in order that He might reach men and bring them back to Him. Just before He was crucified in the flesh and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit ({1Co15:45|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45}), He unveiled His mysterious trinity to His disciples in plain words ({Joh14|John 14}&mdash;{Joh17|17}), stating that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son ({Joh14:9|John 14:9}-{Joh14:11|11}), that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son ({Joh14:16|John 14:16}-{Joh14:20|20}), that the three, coexisting and coinhering simultaneously, are abiding with the believers for their enjoyment ({Joh14:23|John 14:23}; {Joh17:21|17:21}-{Joh17:23|23}), and that all that the Father has is the Son&rsquo;s and all that the Son possesses is received by the Spirit to be declared to the believers ({Joh16:13|John 16:13}-{Joh16:15|15}). Such a Trinity is altogether related to the dispensing of the processed God into His believers ({Joh14:17|John 14:17}, {Joh14:20|20}; {Joh15:4|15:4}-{Joh15:5|5}) that they may be one in and with the Triune God ({Joh17:21|John 17:21}-{Joh17:23|23}).","After His resurrection He charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit ({Mat28:19|Matt. 28:19}); that is, He charged the disciples to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed God, who had passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and had entered into resurrection. Based on such an organic union, the apostle, at the conclusion of this divine Epistle to the Corinthians, blessed them with the blessed Divine Trinity in the participation in the Son&rsquo;s grace with the Father&rsquo;s love through the Spirit&rsquo;s fellowship. In this Divine Trinity, God the Father operates all things in all the members in the church, which is the Body of Christ, through the ministries of the Lord, God the Son, by the gifts of God the Spirit ({1Co12:4|1&nbsp;Cor. 12:4}-{1Co12:6|6}).","The entire divine revelation in the book of Ephesians concerning the producing, existing, growing, building up, and fighting of the church as the Body of Christ is composed of the divine economy, the dispensing of the Triune God into the members of the Body of Christ. {Eph1|Chapter 1} of Ephesians unveils that God the Father chose and predestinated these members in eternity ({Eph1:4|Eph. 1:4}-{Eph1:5|5}), that God the Son redeemed them ({Eph1:6|Eph. 1:6}-{Eph1:12|12}), and that God the Spirit, as a pledge, sealed them ({Eph1:13|Eph. 1:13}-{Eph1:14|14}), thus imparting Himself into His believers for the formation of the church, which is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all ({Eph1:18|Eph. 1:18}-{Eph1:23|23}). {Eph2|Chapter 2} shows us that in the Divine Trinity all the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, have access unto God the Father, through God the Son, in God the Spirit ({Eph2:18|Eph. 2:18}). This indicates that the three coexist and coinhere simultaneously, even after all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. In {2Co3|ch. 3} the apostle prayed that God the Father would grant the believers to be strengthened through God the Spirit into their inner man, that Christ, God the Son, may make His home in their hearts, that is, occupy their entire being, that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God ({Eph3:14|Eph. 3:14}-{Eph3:19|19}). This is the climax of the believers&rsquo; experience of and participation in God in His trinity. {Eph4|Chapter 4} portrays how the processed God as the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father is mingled with the Body of Christ ({Eph4:4|Eph. 4:4}-{Eph4:6|6}) so that all the members of the Body may experience the Divine Trinity. {Eph5|Chapter 5} exhorts the believers to praise the Lord, God the Son, with the songs of God the Spirit, and give thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, God the Son, to God the Father ({Eph5:19|Eph. 5:19}-{Eph5:20|20}). This is to praise and thank the processed God in His divine trinity for our enjoyment of Him as the Triune God. {Eph6|Chapter 6} instructs us to fight the spiritual warfare by being empowered in the Lord, God the Son, putting on the whole armor of God the Father, and wielding the sword of God the Spirit ({Eph6:10|Eph. 6:10}, {Eph6:11|11}, {Eph6:17|17}). This is the believers&rsquo; experience and enjoyment of the Triune God even in the spiritual warfare.","The apostle Peter, in his writing, confirmed that God is triune for the believers&rsquo; enjoyment, referring the believers to the election of God the Father, the sanctification of God the Spirit, and the redemption of Jesus Christ, God the Son, accomplished by His blood ({1Pe1:2|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:2}). And John the apostle strengthened the revelation that the Divine Trinity is for the believers&rsquo; participation in the processed Triune God. In the book of Revelation he blessed the churches in different localities with grace and peace from God the Father, Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from God the Spirit, the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from God the Son, Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth ({Rev1:4|Rev. 1:4}-{Rev1:5|5}). John&rsquo;s blessing given to the churches indicated also that the processed Triune God, in all He is as the eternal Father, in all He is able to do as the sevenfold intensified Spirit, and in all He has attained and obtained as the anointed Son, is for the believers&rsquo; enjoyment, that they may be His corporate testimony as the golden lampstands ({Rev1:9|Rev. 1:9}, {Rev1:11|11}, {Rev1:20|20}).","Thus, it is evident that the divine revelation of the trinity of the Godhead in the holy Word, from Genesis through Revelation, is not for theological study but for the apprehending of how God in His mysterious and marvelous trinity dispenses Himself into His chosen people, that we as His chosen and redeemed people may, as indicated in the apostle&rsquo;s blessing to the Corinthian believers, participate in, experience, enjoy, and possess the processed Triune God now and for eternity.
