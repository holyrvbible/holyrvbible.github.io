verses: {
'1:1': 'Paul and [a]Silvanus and [b]Timothy to the [1c]church of the [2]Thessalonians in [3]God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: [d]Grace to you and peace.',
'1:2': 'We [a]thank God always concerning all of you, making [b]mention <I>of</I> <I>you</I> in our prayers,',
'1:3': 'Remembering unceasingly your [1]work of [2a]faith and [3]labor of [b]love and [4]endurance of [c]hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;',
'1:4': 'Knowing, brothers, [a]beloved of God, your [1b]selection;',
'1:5': 'For our [a]gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in [b]power and in the [c]Holy Spirit and in much assurance, even as you know [1d]what kind of men we were among you for your sake.',
'1:6': 'And you became [1a]imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the [2]word in much affliction with [b]joy of the [c]Holy Spirit,',
'1:7': 'So that you became a [1a]pattern to all those who believe in [b]Macedonia and in [c]Achaia.',
'1:8': 'For from you the word of the Lord has sounded out; not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but in every place, your [1a]faith toward God has gone out, so that we have no need of saying anything.',
'1:9': 'For they themselves report concerning us [1]what kind of entrance we had toward you and how you [2a]turned to God from the [b]idols to [3c]serve a [4d]living and [e]true God',
'1:10': 'And [1a]await His Son from the [b]heavens, whom He [c]raised from the dead, Jesus, who [d]delivers us from the [2e]wrath which is coming.',
'2:1': 'For you yourselves know, brothers, our [1]entrance toward you, that it has not been [a]in vain.',
'2:2': 'But having suffered previously and having been outrageously treated, even as you know, in [1a]Philippi, we were [b]bold [2]in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much [c]struggle.',
'2:3': 'For our [a]exhortation is not out of [1b]deception nor out of [c]uncleanness nor in [d]guile;',
'2:4': 'But even as we have been [1a]approved by God to be [b]entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as [c]pleasing men but God, who [d]proves our hearts.',
'2:5': 'For neither were we found at any time with [a]flattering speech, even as you know, nor with a [1]pretext for [b]covetousness; God is [c]witness.',
'2:6': 'Nor did we [1]seek [a]glory from men, neither from you nor from others, though we could have [2]stood on our authority as [b]apostles of Christ.',
'2:7': 'But we were [a]gentle in your midst, as a [1b]nursing mother would [2c]cherish her own [d]children.',
'2:8': '[1a]Yearning in this way over you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also [2b]our own souls, because you became beloved to us.',
'2:9': 'For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: While [a]working night and day so as not to be [b]burdensome to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.',
'2:10': 'You are witnesses, as well as [a]God, how in a [1]holy and righteous and blameless manner we conducted ourselves toward you who believe,',
'2:11': 'Just as you know [1]how <I>we</I> <I>were</I> to each one of you, as a [2a]father to his own [b]children, [3c]exhorting you and consoling <I>you</I> and testifying,',
'2:12': 'So that you might [a]walk in a manner worthy of God, who [1b]calls you into His own [2c]kingdom and [3d]glory.',
'2:13': 'And because of this we also [a]thank God unceasingly that when you received [1]the word of God, which you heard [2]from us, you accepted <I>it</I> not <I>as</I> the word of men but even as it truly is, the word of God, which also [3]operates in you who believe.',
'2:14': 'For you, brothers, became [1a]imitators of the [b]churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen, even as they also from the Jews,',
'2:15': 'Who both [a]killed the Lord Jesus and the [b]prophets and [c]drove us out; and they are not pleasing to God and are contrary to all men,',
'2:16': 'In that they forbid us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so that they [a]fill up their sins always. But wrath has come upon them to the [1]uttermost.',
'2:17': 'But we, brothers, having been [1]bereaved of you for [2]a little while, in presence, [a]not in heart, were more abundantly [3]eager with great [b]desire to see your face.',
'2:18': 'Therefore we wanted to come to you, indeed I Paul, both once and again, yet [1]Satan [a]hindered us.',
'2:19': 'For what is our [a]hope or [b]joy or crown of [c]boasting before our Lord Jesus at His [1d]coming? Are not even you?',
'2:20': 'For you are our [1]glory and joy.',
'3:1': 'Therefore when we could [a]bear <I>it</I> no longer, we thought it good to be left in [1b]Athens alone,',
'3:2': 'And we sent [a]Timothy, our brother and [1]God&rsquo;s fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, to [b]establish and [2]encourage you for the sake of your [c]faith,',
'3:3': 'That no one would be [1]shaken by these [a]afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are [2b]appointed for this.',
'3:4': 'For even when we were with you, we [1]told you beforehand that we are to be afflicted, even as it also came to pass and you know.',
'3:5': 'Because of this, when I also could [a]bear <I>it</I> no longer, I sent to find out concerning your [b]faith, lest perhaps the [1c]tempter had tempted you and our labor would be [2d]in vain.',
'3:6': 'But [a]Timothy, having just come [1]to us from you and announcing the good news to us of your [b]faith and love and that you have kind [c]remembrance of us always and [d]long to see us, just as we also you,',
'3:7': 'Because of this we were [1a]comforted because of you, brothers, in all our [2]necessity and affliction, through your [b]faith;',
'3:8': 'Because now we [1]live if you [2a]stand firm in the Lord.',
'3:9': 'For what [a]thanks can we return to God concerning you for all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,',
'3:10': 'Night and day petitioning exceedingly so that we may [a]see your face and [1]complete the things that are lacking in your [b]faith?',
'3:11': 'Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus [1a]make straight our path to you;',
'3:12': 'And the Lord cause you to increase and [a]abound in [1b]love to [c]one another and to all, just as we also to you,',
'3:13': '[1]So that He may [a]establish your [2]hearts [b]blameless in [3c]holiness before our God and Father at the [4d]coming of our Lord Jesus [e]with all His [5]saints. [6]',
'4:1': 'Furthermore, brothers, we ask and [a]exhort you in the Lord Jesus that even as you received from us how you ought to walk and [b]please God, even as indeed you do walk, that you [c]abound still more.',
'4:2': 'For you know what [a]charges we gave you through the Lord Jesus.',
'4:3': 'For this is the [a]will of God, your [1b]sanctification: that you [c]abstain from [2d]fornication;',
'4:4': 'That each one of you know how to [1]possess his [a]own [2]vessel in [3]sanctification and [b]honor,',
'4:5': 'Not in the [a]passion of lust, like the [b]Gentiles who do [1c]not know God;',
'4:6': 'That no one [1]overstep and [2]take advantage of his brother in [3]the matter, because the Lord is the [4a]avenger concerning all [5]these things, even as we also said before to you and solemnly charged.',
'4:7': 'For God has not [a]called us [1]for [2b]uncleanness but [3]in [4c]sanctification.',
'4:8': '[1]Consequently, he who [2]rejects, rejects not man but God, who also gives His [3a]Holy Spirit to you.',
'4:9': 'Now concerning [1]brotherly [a]love, you have no need <I>for</I> <I>me</I> to [b]write to you, for you yourselves are [c]taught of God to [2d]love one another;',
'4:10': 'For you also do this unto all the brothers in the whole of [a]Macedonia. But we [b]exhort you, brothers, to [c]abound still more',
'4:11': 'And to aspire to be [a]quiet and attend to your own affairs and work with your [b]hands, even as we [c]charged you,',
'4:12': 'That you may walk [a]becomingly toward those [b]outside and may have [c]need of nothing.',
'4:13': 'But we do not want you to be [a]ignorant, brothers, concerning those who are [1]sleeping, that you would not grieve even as also the rest who have [b]no hope.',
'4:14': 'For if we believe that Jesus died and [a]rose, so also [b]those who have fallen asleep through Jesus, God will bring [c]with Him.',
'4:15': 'For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the [1a]coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep;',
'4:16': 'Because the Lord Himself, with a [1a]shout of command, with the voice of the [b]archangel and with the [2c]trumpet of God, will descend from [d]heaven, and the [e]dead in Christ will [f]rise first.',
'4:17': 'Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be [1a]caught up together [b]with them in the [c]clouds to meet the Lord [2]in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord.',
'4:18': 'Therefore comfort [a]one another with these words.',
'5:1': 'But concerning the [1a]times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need <I>for</I> <I>anything</I> to be [b]written to you;',
'5:2': 'For you yourselves know perfectly well that [1]like a [a]thief in the [b]night, so the [2c]day of the Lord comes.',
'5:3': 'When they say, [a]Peace and security, then [1]sudden [b]destruction comes upon them, just as birth [c]pangs to a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape.',
'5:4': 'But you, brothers, are not in [a]darkness that the day should overtake you like a thief;',
'5:5': 'For you are all sons of [a]light and sons of the [b]day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.',
'5:6': 'So then let us not [1a]sleep, as the rest do, but let us [2b]watch and be [c]sober.',
'5:7': 'For those who sleep, sleep during the [a]night, and those who get [1b]drunk are drunk during the night;',
'5:8': 'But since we are of the [a]day, let us be [b]sober, putting on the [1]breastplate of [c]faith and love and a [1d]helmet, the [2]hope of [3]salvation.',
'5:9': 'For God did [1]not [a]appoint us to [b]wrath but to the obtaining of [2c]salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,',
'5:10': 'Who [1a]died for us in order that whether we [2]watch or [3]sleep, we may [b]live together [4]with Him.',
'5:11': 'Therefore comfort [a]one another, and [b]build up each one the other, even as you also do.',
'5:12': 'Furthermore we ask you, brothers, to [1a]acknowledge [2]those who labor among you and [3]take the [b]lead among you in the Lord and admonish you,',
'5:13': 'And to [1a]regard them most highly in [b]love because of their work. Be [2]at [c]peace among yourselves.',
'5:14': 'And we [a]exhort you, brothers, Admonish the [1b]disorderly, console the [2c]fainthearted, sustain the [3d]weak, be [4e]long-suffering toward all.',
'5:15': 'See that no one repays anyone [a]evil for evil, but [1]always pursue what is [b]good both for [c]one another and for all.',
'5:16': '[1]Always [a]rejoice,',
'5:17': '[1]Unceasingly [a]pray,',
'5:18': '[1]In everything give [a]thanks; [2]for this is the [b]will of God in Christ Jesus for you.',
'5:19': 'Do [1]not quench the [a]Spirit;',
'5:20': 'Do not [1]despise [2]prophecies,',
'5:21': 'But [1]prove all things. Hold fast to what is [a]good;',
'5:22': '[a]Abstain from every [1]kind of evil.',
'5:23': '[1]And the [2]God of [a]peace Himself [3b]sanctify you [4]wholly, and may your [5c]spirit and [d]soul and [e]body be [f]preserved [6]complete, [g]without blame, [7]at the [8h]coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.',

These depict the structure of the genuine Christian life, a life constructed with faith, love, and hope (see {1Co13:13^1|note 13<sup>1</sup>} in {1Co13|1&nbsp;Cor. 13}). Such a life originates not from the ability of the believers&rsquo; natural being but from the infusion of what God, in whom they believe, is. It is carried out by their sacrificial love toward their loving Lord, who loved them and gave Himself for them, and toward His members, whom He has redeemed through His death in love. This life lasts and stands unchanging by the sustaining power of the hope in which the believers look for their beloved Lord, who promised that He would come to take them to Himself. Such a life is the content of this Epistle.","How marvelous that the Thessalonian believers could live such a life through the apostle&rsquo;s short ministry of less than one month! This encourages us to preach the complete gospel to typical unbelievers in full assurance of faith, and to minister the deeper truths concerning the Christian life to new converts.","In the two Epistles to the young church in Thessalonica, the genuine Christian life for the proper church life is revealed in a simple and brief way. It is a life of three dimensions in the light of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, having faith as the beginning, the foundation, love as the process, the construction, and hope as the consummation, the completion. Faith is toward God ({1Th1:8|v. 8}), love is toward the saints ({1Th3:12|3:12}; {1Th4:9|4:9}-{1Th4:10|10}), and hope is in the Lord&rsquo;s coming ({1Th2:19|2:19}). The first Epistle is for encouragement and comfort; the second is for correction and balance. The believers should live, walk, and work by faith and love in the hope of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back; but they should not have the erroneous concept that the Lord will come immediately and, thus, that they need not make any long-range plans. The apostle Paul&rsquo;s writings concerning the Christian life for the church life begin with the book of Romans and conclude with these two Epistles."]},

This is accomplished by faith infused into the new converts through their hearing of the word of the gospel. To serve a living and true God is to serve the very God who is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;who has been processed to be the believers&rsquo; life and life supply for their enjoyment. They should experience Him not only as the object of worship but also as the all-inclusive Supplier who lives in them. This experience is brought about by love produced within the believers by the sweet taste of the rich supply of the Father, through the Son, and in the Spirit. To await the Son of God from the heavens is to look for the One who passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and entered into resurrection and ascended to the heavens, and who will come back to receive His believers into glory.

{sup:"1a", word:"grace", vrefs:"2&nbsp;Thes. 3:18; Rom. 16:20; Gal. 6:18", lines:["See notes {Joh1:14^6|14<sup>6</sup>} and {Joh1:17^1|17<sup>1</sup>} in {Joh1|John 1} and {1Co15:10^1|10<sup>1</sup>} in {1Co15|1&nbsp;Cor. 15}. It is only when we enjoy the Lord as grace that we can live a holy life for the church life, a life that is genuine and proper for the church, lived by our having the Lord as the life supply.","In this book the holy life for the church life is developed. To be sanctified is to be holy. In the universe, only God is holy; only He is distinct and different from all other things. He is not common and therefore is undefiled. Holiness is God&rsquo;s nature; it is an intrinsic characteristic of God&rsquo;s attributes. Therefore, to be holy completely and entirely, to be holy not only in outward position but also in inward disposition, we must have the holy nature that is characteristic of God. To have this divine nature of God, we must possess God, having Him as our life and nature. Only God can sanctify us wholly and can preserve our entire being, our spirit and soul and body, complete, keeping it from being common or defiled. God desires to sanctify us, and He Himself will do it, as long as we are willing to pursue Him as holiness ({Heb12:14|Heb. 12:14a}) and cooperate with Him in this matter. In this way we can be holy as He is holy ({1Pe1:15|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:15}-{1Pe1:16|16}). Without holiness we cannot see Him ({Heb12:14|Heb. 12:14b}).","God not only has made us holy in position by the redeeming blood of Christ ({Heb13:12|Heb. 13:12}; {Heb10:29|10:29}) but also is sanctifying us in disposition by His own holy nature. By thus sanctifying us, He transforms us in the essence of our spirit, soul, and body, making us wholly like Him in nature. In this way He preserves our spirit, soul, and body wholly complete. His making us holy in position is outside of us, whereas His sanctifying us in disposition is within us, beginning from our spirit, the deepest part, passing through our soul, the intermediate part, and reaching to our body, the outer part. This work, which penetrates us deeply, is accomplished through the regeneration of our spirit ({Joh3:6|John 3:6}), the transformation of our soul ({Rom12:2|Rom. 12:2}), and the redemption of our body ({Rom8:23|Rom. 8:23}; {Eph4:30|Eph. 4:30}) by God&rsquo;s life-giving Spirit. Such a holy and sanctified life is necessary for us to have a church life that is pleasing to God and that expresses Him."]},
