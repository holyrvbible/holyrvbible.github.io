'4:11': 'And the [1]skin of the bull and all its flesh with its head and with its legs, and the rest of its inward parts and its dung,',
'4:12': 'That is, all the rest of the bull he shall bring out to a clean place [a]outside the camp, where the [1]ashes are poured out, and burn it on wood with fire; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.',
'4:13': 'Now if the whole assembly of Israel errs, and the matter escapes the notice of the congregation, and they have done any of the things which Jehovah commanded not to be done and become guilty,',
'4:14': 'And when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the congregation shall present a bull of the herd for a [a]sin offering and bring it before the Tent of Meeting.',

'4:31': 'And all its fat he shall remove, just as the fat is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a satisfying fragrance to Jehovah. And the priest shall make expiation for him, and he will be forgiven.',
'4:32': 'And if he brings a [a]lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without blemish.',
'4:33': 'And he shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it for a sin offering in the place where they slaughter the burnt offering.',
'4:34': 'And the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar.',
'4:35': 'And all its fat he shall remove, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar upon Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire. And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning his sin that he has committed, and he will be [a]forgiven.',
'5:1': 'And if anyone [1]sins when he hears the voice of [a]adjuration and he is a witness, either seeing or knowing about a matter, if he [2]does not speak up, then he shall bear his iniquity.',
'5:2': 'Or if anyone touches any [a]unclean thing, whether the [1]carcass of an unclean animal or the carcass of unclean cattle or the carcass of unclean [2]swarming things, and it escapes his notice, and he is unclean, then he will be guilty.',
'5:3': 'Or if he touches the uncleanness of [1]man, whatever his uncleanness is with which he becomes unclean, and it escapes his notice, when he comes to know it, then he will be guilty.',
'5:4': 'Or if anyone [a]swears [1]rashly with his lips to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man utters rashly with an oath, and it escapes his notice, when he comes to know it, then he shall be guilty in one of these things.',
'5:5': 'And when he is guilty in one of these things, he shall [a]confess that in which he has sinned;',
'5:6': 'And he shall bring his [1a]trespass offering to Jehovah for his sin which he has committed, a [2]female from the flock, a sheep or a goat, as a [3]sin offering; and the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin.',
'5:7': 'And if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring as his trespass offering to Jehovah for that in which he has sinned [a]two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a [1]sin offering and the other for a [1]burnt offering.',
'5:8': '[a]And he shall bring them to the priest, who shall present first that which is for the sin offering; and the [1]priest shall wring off its head at the front of its neck but shall not sever it;',
'5:9': 'And he shall sprinkle some of the [1]blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the [a]base of the altar; it is a sin offering.',
'5:10': 'And he shall offer the second as a burnt offering according to the ordinance. And the priest shall make expiation for him on account of his sin which he has committed, and he will be [a]forgiven.',
'5:11': 'But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for that which he has sinned, the [a]tenth of an ephah of [1]fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no [2]oil upon it nor put any [2]frankincense upon it, for it is a sin offering.',
'5:12': 'And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take [1]a handful of it as its memorial portion and [2]burn it on the altar, upon Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire; it is a sin offering.',
'5:13': 'And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning his sin that he has committed in any one of these things, and he will be forgiven. And the [1]rest shall be the priest&rsquo;s, like the meal offering.',
'5:14': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'5:15': 'If anyone acts unfaithfully and sins without intent in the holy things of Jehovah, then he shall bring his trespass offering to Jehovah, a [1a]ram without blemish out of the flock according to your valuation in silver by [b]shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.',
'5:16': 'And he shall make [1]restitution for the holy thing in which he has sinned, and he shall add to it a [a]fifth part of it and give it to the priest. And the priest shall make expiation for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and he will be forgiven.',
'5:17': 'And if anyone sins and does any one of the things which Jehovah has commanded not to be done, though he did not [a]know, he is still guilty and shall bear his iniquity.',
'5:18': 'And he shall bring to the priest a [a]ram without blemish out of the flock according to your valuation for a trespass offering. And the priest shall make expiation for him concerning the matter in which he erred without intent and did not know, and he will be forgiven.',
'5:19': 'It is a trespass offering; he is certainly guilty before Jehovah.',
'6:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'6:2': 'If anyone sins and [a]acts unfaithfully against Jehovah and deceives his associate in regard to a [b]deposit or a security, or by robbery, or has extorted from his associate,',
'6:3': 'Or has [a]found a lost item and lied about it, if he has sworn falsely in any one of all these things a man may do, and sins thereby;',
'6:4': 'Then if he has sinned and is guilty, he shall [1]restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he got by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted to him, or the lost item which he found,',
'6:5': 'Or anything about which he has sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in full, and shall add to it a [a]fifth part of it. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs, on the day [1]he is found guilty.',
'6:6': 'And he shall bring to Jehovah his trespass offering, a [a]ram without blemish out of the flock according to your valuation for a trespass offering; to the priest he shall bring it.',
'6:7': 'And the priest shall make expiation for him before Jehovah, and he will be [a]forgiven for any of the things which he may have done so as to be guilty.',
'6:8': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'6:9': 'Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the [1]law of the [a]burnt offering: The burnt offering shall be on the [2]hearth on the altar [3]all night until the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be [4]kept burning on it.',
'6:10': 'And the priest shall put on his [a]linen garment, and his linen trousers he shall put on his flesh; and he shall take up the [1]ashes to which the fire has consumed the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.',
'6:11': 'Then he shall take off his garments and put on other garments and carry the ashes [a]outside the camp to a clean place.',
'6:12': 'And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it; it must not go out. And the priest shall burn wood on it every [1]morning, and he shall lay the [2]burnt offering in order upon it and shall burn the [a]fat of the [2]peace offerings on it.',
'6:13': 'Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually; it shall not go out.',
'6:14': 'And this is the law of the [a]meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall present it [1]before Jehovah before the altar.',
'6:15': '[1]And one shall take up from it his handful of the fine flour of the meal offering and of its oil and all the frankincense which is on the meal offering, and he shall burn it on the altar for a satisfying fragrance as its memorial portion to Jehovah.',
'6:16': 'And what is [a]left of it [1]Aaron and his sons may [b]eat; it shall be eaten [2]without leaven in a holy place; in the [2]court of the Tent of Meeting they shall eat it.',
'6:17': 'It shall not be baked with [1a]leaven. I have given it as their portion of My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the [2]sin offering and like the [2]trespass offering.',
'6:18': 'Every [1]male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations from Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire; whoever touches them shall be holy.',
'6:19': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'6:20': 'This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall present to Jehovah in the [1]day when he is anointed: the [2a]tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a continual meal offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening.',
'6:21': 'On a flat plate it shall be prepared with oil; when it is mixed, you shall bring it; as a meal offering of baked pieces you shall present it as a satisfying [a]fragrance to Jehovah.',
'6:22': 'And the priest anointed to be in his place from among his sons shall prepare it. It shall be a perpetual statute; it shall be wholly burned to Jehovah.',
'6:23': 'And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly burned; it must not be eaten.',
'6:24': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'6:25': 'Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the [a]sin offering: In the [b]place where the [1]burnt offering is slaughtered the sin offering shall be slaughtered before Jehovah; it is [2]most holy.',
'6:26': 'The [1]priest who offers it for sin shall [a]eat it. In a holy place it shall be eaten, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.',
'6:27': 'Whatever touches its flesh shall be [1]holy. And when any of its blood splashes on a garment, you shall [2a]wash whatever was splashed in a holy place.',

'7:6': 'Every [1]male among the priests may [a]eat of it; it shall be eaten in a [1]holy place; it is most holy.',
'7:7': 'The trespass offering is like the sin offering; there is [1]one law for them: The [2a]priest who makes expiation with it shall have it.',
'7:8': 'And the priest who presents anyone&rsquo;s burnt offering, that priest shall have for himself the [1a]skin of the burnt offering which he has presented.',
'7:9': 'And every meal offering that is baked in an oven and everything that is made in a pot or on a flat plate shall belong to the [1]priest who presents it.',
'7:10': 'And every other meal offering, mingled with oil or dry, shall be for all the sons of Aaron, to each alike.',
'7:11': 'Now this is the law of the sacrifice of [a]peace offerings that one shall present to [1]Jehovah:',
'7:12': 'If he presents it for a thanksgiving, then he shall present with the [1]sacrifice of thanksgiving [a]unleavened cakes mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and saturated cakes of fine flour mingled with oil.',

'7:14': 'And from [1]it he shall present one out of each offering as a [a]heave offering to Jehovah; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.',
'7:15': 'And the flesh of the [a]sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering; he shall [1]not leave any of it until the morning.',
'7:16': '[a]But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he presents his sacrifice, and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten;',
'7:17': 'But what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burned with fire.',
'7:18': 'And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is eaten at all on the third day, it will not be accepted, neither will it be reckoned to the one who presents it; it will be an [1]abomination, and the person who eats of it shall bear his own [1]iniquity.',
'7:19': 'And flesh that touches any [1]unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. And as for other flesh, anyone who is [1]clean may eat such flesh.',
'7:20': 'But the person who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to Jehovah, with his uncleanness upon him, that person shall be [1]cut off from his people.',
'7:21': 'And when anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man or an unclean beast or any unclean abomination, and eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong to Jehovah, that person shall be cut off from his people.',
'7:22': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'7:23': 'Speak to the children of Israel, saying, You shall not eat any [1a]fat of an ox or of a sheep or of a goat.',
'7:24': 'And the fat of an animal that dies and the fat of an animal which is torn by beasts may be put to any other use, but [1a]you shall by no means eat it.',
'7:25': 'For whoever eats the [1]fat of a beast from which someone presents an offering by fire to Jehovah, indeed the person who eats it shall be cut off from his people.',
'7:26': 'And you shall not eat any [1]blood, either of bird or of beast, in any of your dwelling places.',

'7:30': 'His own hands shall bring Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire; the fat with the breast he shall bring, that the breast may be waved as a [1a]wave offering before Jehovah.',
'7:31': 'And the priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the [a]breast shall be for Aaron and for his sons.',
'7:32': 'And the right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.',
'7:33': 'The one among the sons of Aaron who presents the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh as his portion.',
'7:34': 'For the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering I have taken from the children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons for a perpetual statute to be observed by the children of Israel.',
'7:35': 'This is the [1a]anointing portion of Aaron and the anointing portion of his sons, from Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire, in the day when he presented them to serve Jehovah as priests,',
'7:36': 'Which Jehovah commanded to be given them from the children of Israel in the day that He anointed them. It shall be a perpetual statute throughout their generations.',
'7:37': 'This is the [a]law of the burnt offering and of the meal offering and of the sin offering and of the trespass offering and of the [1]consecration and of the sacrifice of [2]peace offerings,',
'7:38': 'Which Jehovah commanded Moses on Mount Sinai, on the day that He commanded the children of Israel to present their offerings to Jehovah in the wilderness of Sinai.',
'8:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'8:2': 'Take [1a]Aaron and his sons with him, and the [b]garments and the [c]anointing oil and the bull of the sin offering and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread;',
'8:3': 'And gather all the assembly at the [1]entrance of the Tent of Meeting.',
'8:4': 'And Moses did just as Jehovah had commanded him, and the assembly was gathered at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.',
'8:5': 'And Moses said to the assembly, This is what Jehovah has commanded to be done.',
'8:6': '[a]And Moses brought Aaron and his sons near and [1]washed them with water.',
'8:7': '[a]And he [1]put the [b]tunic upon him and girded him with the girding sash and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and with it he bound it to him.',
'8:8': 'And he placed the breastplate upon him, and in the breastplate he put the [a]Urim and the Thummim.',
'8:9': 'And he placed the turban on his head, and on the turban, on its front, he placed the [a]golden plate, the holy crown, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'8:10': 'And Moses took the anointing oil and [1a]anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and [2]sanctified them.',
'8:11': 'And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.',
'8:12': 'And he poured some of the [a]anointing oil on [1]Aaron&rsquo;s head and anointed him, to sanctify him.',
'8:13': 'And Moses [a]brought Aaron&rsquo;s sons near, and [1]clothed them with tunics and girded them with girding sashes and bound high hats on them, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'8:14': '[a]And he brought the [1]bull of the [2]sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.',
'8:15': 'And he slaughtered it; and Moses took the blood and put some of it on and around the horns of the altar with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and sanctified it, to make expiation for it.',
'8:16': 'And he took all the fat that was on the inward parts and the appendage of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses burned them on the altar.',
'8:17': 'But the bull and its skin and its flesh and its dung he burned with fire [a]outside the camp, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'8:18': '[a]And he presented the [1]ram of the [2]burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.',
'8:19': 'And he slaughtered it, and Moses sprinkled the blood on and around the altar.',
'8:20': 'And he cut the ram into its pieces, and Moses burned the head and the pieces and the fat.',
'8:21': 'And the inward parts and the legs he washed with water, and Moses burned the whole ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a satisfying fragrance; it was an offering by fire to Jehovah, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'8:22': '[a]And he presented the other ram, the [1]ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.',
'8:23': 'And he slaughtered it, and Moses took some of its blood and put it on the [a]lobe of Aaron&rsquo;s right [1]ear and on the thumb of his right [1]hand and on the big toe of his right [1]foot.',
'8:24': 'And he brought Aaron&rsquo;s sons near, and Moses put some of the blood on the lobe of their right ear and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot; and Moses sprinkled the rest of the blood on and around the altar.',
'8:25': 'And he took the fat and the fat tail and all the fat that was on the inward parts, and the appendage of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh;',
'8:26': 'And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before Jehovah, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of oiled bread and one wafer, and placed them on the fat portions and on the right thigh.',
'8:27': 'And he put all these in the palms of Aaron and in the palms of his sons, and he waved them as a wave offering before Jehovah.',
'8:28': 'And Moses took them from their palms and burned them on the altar upon the burnt offering. They were an offering of consecration for a satisfying fragrance; it was an offering by fire to Jehovah.',
'8:29': 'And Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before Jehovah; it was Moses&rsquo; portion of the ram of consecration, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'8:30': '[a]And Moses took some of the [1]anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments, and on his sons and on his sons&rsquo; garments with him; and he sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons and his sons&rsquo; garments with him.',
'8:31': 'And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, [a]Boil the flesh at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of consecration, just as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.',
'8:32': 'And what is left of the flesh and of the bread you shall burn with fire.',
'8:33': 'And you shall not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting for [1a]seven days, until the days of your [b]consecration are fulfilled, for it will take [2]seven days to consecrate you.',
'8:34': 'As has been done this day, so Jehovah has commanded to do, to make expiation for you.',
'8:35': 'And at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting you shall stay day and night seven days, and keep the charge of Jehovah, that you may not [1]die; for so I have been commanded.',
'8:36': 'And Aaron and his sons did all the things which Jehovah had commanded through Moses.',
'9:1': 'Now on the [1a]eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel;',
'9:2': 'And he said to Aaron, Take for [1]yourself a calf of the herd for a [a]sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and present them before Jehovah.',
'9:3': 'Then to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take a [a]male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering;',
'9:4': 'And an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and a [a]meal offering mingled with oil; for today Jehovah will [b]appear to you.',
'9:5': 'So they brought what Moses had commanded before the Tent of Meeting, and all the assembly came near and stood before Jehovah.',
'9:6': 'And Moses said, This is what Jehovah has commanded you to do, and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.',
'9:7': 'Then Moses said to Aaron, Come near to the altar and offer your [a]sin offering and your burnt offering, and make expiation for [b]yourself and for the people; and make the offering of the people and make expiation for them, just as Jehovah has commanded.',
'9:8': 'So Aaron came near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.',
'9:9': 'And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it on the [a]horns of the altar, and the rest of the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.',
'9:10': 'But the [a]fat and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver of the sin offering he burned on the altar, just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'9:11': 'And the [a]flesh and the skin he burned with fire [b]outside the camp.',
'9:12': '[a]Then he slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons handed the blood to him, and he sprinkled it on and around the altar.',
'9:13': 'And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.',
'9:14': 'And he washed the inward parts and the legs and burned them upon the burnt offering on the altar.',
'9:15': 'Then he presented the [1]people&rsquo;s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people and slaughtered it and [a]offered it for sin, like the first.',
'9:16': 'And he presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.',
'9:17': 'Then he presented the [a]meal offering and filled his hand with some of it and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.',
'9:18': 'Then he slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of [1a]peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons handed the blood to him, which he sprinkled on and around the altar.',
'9:19': 'And the fat portions of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and the fat which covers the inward parts and the kidneys and the appendage of the liver&mdash;',
'9:20': 'These fat portions they then put on the breasts; and he burned the fat portions on the altar.',
'9:21': 'And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a [a]wave offering before Jehovah, just as Moses had commanded.',
'9:22': 'And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and [1a]blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.',
'9:23': 'And Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting. And they came out and [1]blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah [2a]appeared to all the people.',
'9:24': 'Then [1a]fire came forth from before Jehovah and consumed the burnt offering and the fat portions on the altar. And when all the people saw it, they gave a ringing shout and fell on their faces.',
'10:1': 'And [1]Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in them and laid incense on it, and they presented [2]strange [a]fire before Jehovah, which He had not commanded them.',
'10:2': 'And [1a]fire came out from before Jehovah and consumed them, and they died before Jehovah.',
'10:3': 'Then Moses said to Aaron, This is what Jehovah spoke, saying,<br>[a]In those who come near to Me I will be [1]sanctified,<br>And before all the people I will be [1]glorified.<br>And Aaron was silent.',
'10:4': 'And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, Come near; carry your brothers from before the sanctuary to the [1]outside of the camp.',
'10:5': 'So they came near and carried them in their tunics to the outside of the camp, just as Moses had said.',
'10:6': 'Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, Do not [1]dishevel the hair of your heads, and do not [1]tear your garments, that you may not die and that He may not be angry with all the assembly. But let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, [2]weep for the burning which Jehovah has kindled.',
'10:7': 'And you shall not go out from the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the [a]anointing oil of Jehovah is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.',
'10:8': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Aaron, saying,',
'10:9': '[1]Drink no [a]wine or strong drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the Tent of Meeting, that you may not die; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations,',
'10:10': 'Both to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;',
'10:11': 'And to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Jehovah has spoken to them through Moses.',
'10:12': 'Then Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, Take the [1]meal offering which [a]remains of Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire, and eat it unleavened beside the altar; for it is most holy.',
'10:13': 'And you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is [a]your due and your sons&rsquo; due of Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire; for so I have been commanded.',
'10:14': 'And the [1]breast of the wave offering and the [1]thigh of the heave offering you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been given as your due and your sons&rsquo; due out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.',
'10:15': 'The thigh of the heave offering and the breast of the wave offering they shall bring with the offerings by fire of the fat portions to wave as a wave offering before Jehovah, and it shall become a perpetual statute for you and for your sons with you, just as Jehovah has commanded.',
'10:16': 'Then Moses diligently inquired about the [a]goat of the sin offering, but it had already been burned. So he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,',
'10:17': 'Why have you not [a]eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary? For it is most holy, and He gave it to you to [1]bear the iniquity of the assembly, to make [2]expiation for them before Jehovah.',
'10:18': 'Now its [a]blood was not brought inside, into the sanctuary; you should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded.',
'10:19': 'But Aaron spoke to Moses, See, today they have presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before Jehovah, and such things as these have befallen me! And if I had [1]eaten the sin offering today, would it have been good in the sight of Jehovah?',
'10:20': 'And when Moses heard that, it seemed good in his sight.',
'11:1': '[1]Then Jehovah spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,',
'11:2': 'Speak to the children of Israel, saying, These are the animals which you may [1a]eat among all the beasts that are on the earth.',
'11:3': 'Whatever [1]has a divided hoof, that is, has its hoof split in two, and chews the cud among the beasts, that you may eat.',
'11:4': 'However these you shall not eat: of those that only chew the cud or of those that only have a divided hoof: the [a]camel, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.',
'11:5': 'And the hyrax, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.',
'11:6': 'And the hare, for though it chews the cud, it does not have a divided hoof; it is unclean to you.',
'11:7': 'And the [a]pig, for though it has a divided hoof, that is, it has its hoof split in two, it does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you.',
'11:8': 'You shall not eat of their flesh, nor shall you touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.',
'11:9': 'These you may eat of all that are in the water: anything in the water that has [1]fins and scales, in the seas or in the rivers; these you may eat.',
'11:10': 'But anything that does not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of anything that swarms in the waters and of any living animal which is in the waters, they are an abomination to you,',
'11:11': 'And they shall be an abomination to you; you shall not eat of their flesh, and their carcasses you shall regard as an abomination.',
'11:12': 'Anything in the water that does not have fins or scales is an abomination to you.',
'11:13': 'And these you shall regard as an abomination among the [1]birds; they shall not be eaten; they are an abomination: the great [a]vulture and the bearded vulture and the black vulture',
'11:14': 'And the kite and the falcon of every kind,',
'11:15': 'Every [a]raven of every kind,',
'11:16': 'And the ostrich and the nighthawk and the sea gull and the hawk of every kind,',

'11:18': 'And the white owl and the pelican and the carrion vulture',
'11:19': 'And the stork; the heron of every kind and the hoopoe and the bat;',
'11:20': 'All [1]flying insects that go on all fours are an abomination to you.',
'11:21': 'Yet these you may eat of all flying insects that go on all fours, which have [1]legs above their feet with which to leap on the earth;',
'11:22': 'These of them you may eat: the swarming [a]locust of every kind and the swallowing locust of every kind and the cricket of every kind and the grasshopper of every kind.',
'11:23': 'But all the other flying insects which have four feet are an abomination to you.',
'11:24': 'And by these you shall become unclean; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening,',
'11:25': 'And whoever carries any part of their carcass shall [1]wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.',
'11:26': 'For every beast which has a divided hoof but does not have its hoof split in two or chew the cud is unclean to you; everyone who touches them shall be unclean.',
'11:27': 'And whatever goes on its paws, among all beasts that go on all fours, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcass shall be unclean until the evening.',
'11:28': 'And the one who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.',
'11:29': 'And these are unclean to you among the [1]swarming things that swarm on the earth: the weasel and the mouse and the great lizard of every kind,',
'11:30': 'And the gecko and the land crocodile and the lizard and the sand lizard and the chameleon.',
'11:31': 'These are unclean to you among all the swarming things; whoever touches them when they are [1]dead shall be unclean [2]until the evening.',
'11:32': 'And anything on which one of them may fall when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it is any article of wood or clothing or skin or sackcloth; any article which is used for any work must be put into [1]water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; then it shall be clean.',
'11:33': 'And any earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean, and the [1]vessel you shall break.',
'11:34': 'Any [1]food that could be eaten shall be unclean if water from such a vessel comes upon it, and any [1]liquid that may be drunk shall be unclean if it was in any such vessel.',
'11:35': 'And everything on which part of their carcass falls shall be unclean&mdash;an oven or a stove shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean and shall continue to be unclean to you.',
'11:36': 'Nevertheless a [1]spring or a cistern collecting water shall be clean, but whatever touches their carcass shall be unclean.',
'11:37': 'And if any part of their carcass falls on any [1]seed for sowing, which is to be sown, it is clean.',
'11:38': 'But if water is put on the seed, and any part of their carcass fall on it, it is unclean to you.',
'11:39': 'And if any beast which you have for food dies, the one who touches its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.',
'11:40': 'And he who eats some of its carcass shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; the one who carries its carcass shall also wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.',
'11:41': 'Now every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.',
'11:42': 'Whatever goes on its stomach and whatever goes on all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all the swarming things that swarm on the earth, you shall not eat them, for they are an abomination.',
'11:43': 'You shall not make yourselves abominable with any swarming thing that swarms, nor shall you make yourselves unclean with them, and so become defiled by them.',
'11:44': 'For I am Jehovah your God. Sanctify yourselves therefore, and [a]be holy, for [b]I am holy. And you shall not defile yourselves with any of the swarming things that move upon the earth.',
'11:45': 'For I am Jehovah, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God; [a]you shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.',
'11:46': 'This is the law of the beast and of the bird, and of every living animal that moves in the waters, and of every creature that swarms upon the earth;',
'11:47': 'To make a distinction between the unclean and the [1]clean, and between the animal that may be eaten and the animal that may not be eaten.',
'12:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'12:2': 'Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a [1]woman conceives seed and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean [2]seven days; as in the days of her menstruation, she shall be unclean.',
'12:3': 'And on the [1]eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be [1a]circumcised.',

'21:9': 'And the daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself through prostitution, she profanes her father; she shall be burnt with fire.',
'21:10': 'And he who is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the [1a]anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to [1]put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go [1]loose nor [1]tear his clothes.',

'21:16': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'21:17': 'Speak to Aaron, saying, No one of your seed throughout their generations who has a [1]defect shall approach to present the food of his God.',
'21:18': 'For no one who has a [1]defect shall approach: one who is blind or lame or with a disfigured nose or with an extended limb,',

'22:2': 'Tell Aaron and his sons to [1]be careful with the [2]holy things of the children of Israel, which they sanctify to Me, so that they do not profane My holy name; I am Jehovah.',
'22:3': 'Say to them, If anyone among all your seed throughout your generations approaches the holy things, which the children of Israel sanctify to Jehovah, and his [1]uncleanness is upon him, that person shall be cut off from before Me; I am Jehovah.',
'22:4': 'No one of the seed of Aaron who is a [a]leper or who has a [b]discharge may eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whoever touches anything that is unclean because of contact with a [c]dead person, or a man whose seed of copulation has gone from him,',
'22:5': 'Or whoever touches any [a]creeping thing by which he may be made unclean, or a man by whom he may be made unclean, whatever his uncleanness,',
'22:6': 'The person who touches any such thing shall be unclean until the evening and shall not eat of the holy things unless he has [a]bathed his [1]body in water.',
'22:7': 'And when the sun sets, he shall be clean; and afterward he may eat of the holy things, because it is his [a]food.',
'22:8': 'He shall not eat an animal which has died or is torn by beasts to become unclean by it; I am Jehovah.',
'22:9': 'They shall therefore keep My charge, so that they do not bring sin upon themselves because of it and die by it because they profane it; I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.',
'22:10': 'No [1]stranger may [a]eat any holy thing; a sojourner with a priest or a hired servant shall not eat any holy thing.',
'22:11': 'But if a priest acquires anyone through a purchase with his money, that one may eat of it; and those who are born in his house may [a]eat of his food.',
'22:12': 'And if a priest&rsquo;s [1]daughter is married to a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.',
'22:13': 'But if a priest&rsquo;s daughter becomes a widow or divorced and has no child, and she returns to her [a]father&rsquo;s house as in her youth, she may eat of her father&rsquo;s food; but no stranger may eat of it.',
'22:14': 'And if a man eats the holy thing in ignorance, then he shall add [a]one-fifth of its value to it and shall give the holy thing to the priest.',
'22:15': 'And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel that they offer to Jehovah,',
'22:16': 'And so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt when they eat their holy things; for I am Jehovah who sanctifies them.',
'22:17': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'22:18': 'Speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, When anyone of the house of Israel or of the sojourners in Israel presents his [a]offering, whether it is any of their [1b]vows or any of their [1]freewill offerings which they present to Jehovah for a burnt offering;',
'22:19': 'It shall be a male without [a]blemish from the cattle, from the sheep, or from the goats, for you to be accepted.',
'22:20': 'But whatever has a blemish, you shall not present, for it will not be acceptable for you.',
'22:21': 'And whoever presents a sacrifice of peace offerings to Jehovah to [1]make a special [a]vow or for a freewill offering, from the herd or from the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it.',
'22:22': 'You shall not present these to Jehovah: anything blind or injured or maimed or having a suppuration or eczema or scale; nor shall you make an offering by fire from them on the altar to Jehovah.',
'22:23': 'An ox or a lamb that has anything [1]superfluous or lacking in its parts, that you may offer for a freewill offering; but it shall not be accepted for a vow.',
'22:24': 'And anything with its testicles bruised or crushed or broken or cut, you shall not present to Jehovah; you shall not do this in your land.',

'22:28': 'But whether cow or sheep, you shall not slaughter both it and its young on one day.',
'22:29': 'And when you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Jehovah, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.',

'24:7': 'And you shall put pure [1a]frankincense on each row, so that it may be a memorial for the bread, an [2]offering by fire to Jehovah.',
'24:8': 'Every [1]Sabbath day continually he shall set it in order before Jehovah; it is an everlasting covenant for the children of Israel.',
'24:9': 'And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall [a]eat it in a [1]holy place, for it is most holy to him of Jehovah&rsquo;s offerings by fire, a perpetual statute.',
'24:10': '[1]Now the son of an Israelite woman, who was also the son of an Egyptian man, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a certain Israelite struggled together in the camp.',
'24:11': 'And the son of the Israelite woman [1a]blasphemed the Name and cursed, and they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother&rsquo;s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)',
'24:12': 'And they put him in custody so that it might be declared to them by the mouth of Jehovah.',
'24:13': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'24:14': 'Bring forth the one who has cursed outside the camp; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the assembly stone him.',
'24:15': 'And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, Anyone who curses his God shall bear his sin.',
'24:16': 'And the one who blasphemes the name of Jehovah shall surely be put to [a]death; all the assembly shall surely stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.',
'24:17': 'And anyone who [1a]takes the life of any human being shall surely be put to death.',
'24:18': 'And the one who [1]takes the life of a beast shall make restitution for it, [2]life for life.',
'24:19': 'And anyone who causes an injury to his fellow countryman, as he has done, so shall it be done to him:',
'24:20': 'A fracture for a fracture, an [a]eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; just as he has caused an injury to a man, so it will be inflicted on him.',
'24:21': 'And one who kills a beast shall make restitution for it, but one who kills a human being shall be put to death.',
'24:22': 'You shall have one judgment for the sojourner as well as for the native, for I am Jehovah your God.',
'24:23': 'And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and they brought forth the one who had cursed outside the camp and stoned him with stones. So the children of Israel did just as Jehovah had commanded Moses.',
'25:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,',
'25:2': 'Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land which I am giving you, the land shall observe a [1a]Sabbath to Jehovah.',
'25:3': '[a]Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its produce;',
'25:4': 'But in the seventh year the land shall have a Sabbath of complete rest, a Sabbath to Jehovah; you shall [1]not sow your field nor prune your vineyard.',
'25:5': 'The aftergrowth of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your unpruned vine you shall not gather; the land shall have a year of complete rest.',
'25:6': 'And the Sabbath produce of the land shall be for [1]food for you; for you and for your male slaves and for your female slaves, and for your hired servant and for your stranger, who sojourns with you,',
'25:7': 'And for your cattle and for the animals that are in your land, shall all its produce be for food.',
'25:8': 'And you shall count off [1]seven Sabbaths of years to yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of seven Sabbaths of years, that is, forty-nine years.',
'25:9': 'Then you shall sound aloud the ram&rsquo;s horn in the seventh month on the tenth day of the month; on the [1a]Day of Expiation you shall sound the [b]trumpet throughout all your land.',
'25:10': 'And you shall sanctify the [1]fiftieth year, and proclaim [2]liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a [3a]jubilee for you; and each of you shall return to his [2]possession, and each of you shall return to his [2]family.',
'25:11': 'The fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; you shall [1]not sow nor reap its aftergrowth nor gather from its unpruned vines.',
'25:12': 'For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its produce out of the field.',
'25:13': 'In this year of jubilee each one of you shall return to his possession.',
'25:14': 'And if you sell anything to your fellow countryman or buy from the hand of your fellow countryman, you shall not wrong one another.',
'25:15': '[a]According to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy from your fellow countryman; according to the number of crop years remaining he shall sell to you.',
'25:16': 'According to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and according to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price; for it is the number of crop years that he sells to you.',
'25:17': 'And you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am Jehovah your God.',
'25:18': 'Thus you shall observe My statutes, and you shall keep My ordinances and observe them, so that you dwell securely in the land.',
'25:19': 'Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat to be satisfied and dwell securely in it.',
'25:20': 'And if you should say, What shall we eat the seventh year if we do not sow or gather in our produce?',
'25:21': 'Then I will command My blessing for you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for [1]three years.',
'25:22': 'When you sow in the eighth year you will eat of the old produce until the ninth year; until its produce comes in, you shall eat the old produce.',
'25:23': 'And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, because the [a]land is [1]Mine; for you are [b]strangers and sojourners with Me.',
'25:24': 'And in all the land of your possession you shall provide for the [1]redemption of the land.',
'25:25': 'If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his possession, then his redeemer, the nearest [a]relative, shall come and [b]redeem what his brother has sold.',
'25:26': 'But if a man does not have anyone to redeem it, but he obtains the means and finds it sufficient to redeem it,',
'25:27': 'Then let him calculate the [a]years since its sale and restore the excess to the man to whom he sold it, and return to his possession.',
'25:28': 'But if he has not found sufficient means to restore it for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hand of the one who has purchased it until the year of [a]jubilee; and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return to his possession.',
'25:29': 'And if anyone sells a dwelling [1]house in a walled city, then he may redeem it until the end of a year from its sale; for a full year he shall have the right of redemption.',
'25:30': 'But if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall pass in perpetuity to the one who purchased it throughout his generations; it shall not go out in the jubilee.',
'25:31': 'But the [1]houses of the villages which have no wall all around them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.',
'25:32': 'As for the [a]cities of the Levites, that is, the [1]houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites shall have the permanent right of redemption.',
'25:33': 'And what can be redeemed from the Levites, that is, a house that was sold in a city of his possession, shall go out in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel.',
'25:34': 'But the [1]field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.',
'25:35': 'And if your [1]brother becomes [a]poor, and [2]he is unable to support himself as he lives beside you, then you shall support him, like a stranger and a sojourner, so that he may live beside you.',
'25:36': 'Do not take any interest or gain from him, but fear your God, so that your brother may live beside you.',
'25:37': 'You shall not give him your money at interest nor give him your food for gain.',
'25:38': '[a]I am Jehovah your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan, to be your God.',
'25:39': 'And if your brother beside you becomes poor, and he [1]sells himself to you, you shall not make him serve as a slave.',
'25:40': 'He shall be beside you as a hired servant, as a sojourner; he shall serve beside you until the year of jubilee.',
'25:41': 'Then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him, and return to his own family, and he shall return to the possession of his forefathers.',
'25:42': 'For they are My [a]servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves are sold.',
'25:43': 'You shall not rule over him with [a]severity, but you shall fear your God.',
'25:44': 'And as for your male slaves and female slaves whom you may have, they shall come from the [1]nations that are around you; from them you may buy male slaves and female slaves.',
'25:45': 'Moreover from the children of the strangers who sojourn among you, from them you may buy, and from their families who are with you, which they have begotten in your land; they also may be your possession.',
'25:46': 'And you shall make them an inheritance for your children after you, to receive as a possession; you may use them as permanent slaves. But you shall not rule over your brothers the children of Israel, one over another, with severity.',
'25:47': 'And if a stranger or sojourner with you can afford it, and your [1]brother beside him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner with you, or to the descendants of the stranger&rsquo;s family;',
'25:48': 'After he has sold himself, he may be redeemed; one of his [a]brothers may redeem him,',
'25:49': 'Or his uncle or his uncle&rsquo;s son may redeem him, or any of his close relatives of his family may redeem him; or if he can afford it, he may redeem himself.',
'25:50': 'And he shall reckon with the one who bought him from the year that he sold himself to him until the year of jubilee, and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years. The time he shall be with him shall be calculated like the time of a hired servant.',
'25:51': 'If there are still many years, in proportion to them he shall give back the amount for his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.',
'25:52': 'And if there are only a few years remaining until the year of jubilee, so he shall reckon with him. In proportion to his years he shall give back the amount for his redemption.',
'25:53': 'Like a servant hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule with severity over him in your sight.',
'25:54': 'And if he is not redeemed by these means, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, he and his children with him.',
'25:55': 'For the children of Israel are My servants; they are My [a]servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; I am Jehovah your God.',
'26:1': 'You shall not make for yourselves [1a]idols, nor shall you raise up for yourselves a graven image or a pillar, nor shall you place a stone figure in your land to bow down to it; for I am Jehovah your God.',
'26:2': 'You shall keep My [1a]Sabbaths and reverence My [2]sanctuary; I am Jehovah.',
'26:3': 'If you [1]walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and do them,',
'26:4': 'Then I will give you your [1a]rains in their season, and the land will yield its produce, and the trees of the field will yield their fruit.',
'26:5': 'Indeed your threshing will overtake the vintage, and the vintage will overtake the sowing time. Thus you will eat your bread unto satisfaction and dwell securely in your land.',
'26:6': 'And I will give you peace in the land, so that you will lie down and no one will make you afraid; and I will cause wild beasts to cease out of the land, and no sword will pass through your land.',
'26:7': 'And you will chase your enemies, and they will fall by the sword before you.',
'26:8': 'And five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will [a]chase ten thousand; and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.',
'26:9': 'And I will turn My face toward you and make you fruitful and [a]multiply you, and I will establish My [b]covenant with you.',
'26:10': 'And you will eat the old supply long stored and will have to clear out the old because of the new.',
'26:11': 'And I will set My [a]tabernacle among you; and My soul will not abhor you.',
'26:12': 'And I will walk [a]among you and be your [b]God, and you will be My people.',
'26:13': 'I am Jehovah your God, who brought you [a]out of the land of Egypt so that you should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bars of your yoke and made you walk upright.',
'26:14': '[a]But if you will not [1]listen to Me and will not do all these commandments,',
'26:15': 'And if you reject My statutes, and if your soul abhors My ordinances so that you will not do all My commandments, so as to break My [a]covenant;',
'26:16': 'I also will do this to you: I will appoint [1]sudden terror over you, even consumption and fever, that will cause the eyes to fail and make the soul to pine away; and you will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it.',
'26:17': 'And I will set My face against you, and you will be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one pursues you.',
'26:18': 'And if after these things you will not listen to Me, then I will [1]chastise you [a]seven times more for your sins.',
'26:19': 'And I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky like iron and your land like bronze,',
'26:20': 'And your strength will be spent in vain, for your land will [a]not yield its produce, nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit.',
'26:21': 'And if you walk contrary to Me and will not listen to Me, I will bring [a]seven times more [1]plagues upon you according to your sins.',
'26:22': 'And I will send [1]wild animals among you, which will bereave you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number, so that your roads will be deserted.',
'26:23': 'And if by these things you will not be corrected by Me, but walk contrary to Me,',
'26:24': 'Then I also will walk contrary to you; and I will [1]strike you, I Myself, [a]seven times for your sins.',
'26:25': 'And I will bring a [1]sword upon you that will execute the vengeance of the covenant. And when you gather together within your cities, I will send [1]pestilence among you, and you will be [1]delivered into the hand of the enemy.',
'26:26': 'When I [1]cut off your supply of bread, ten women will bake your bread in one oven; and they will return your bread [2]by [a]weight, and you will eat and not be satisfied.',
'26:27': 'And if in spite of this you will not listen to Me, but walk contrary to Me,',
'26:28': 'Then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I will [1]chastise you, I Myself, [a]seven times for your sins.',
'26:29': 'And you will [1]eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat.',
'26:30': 'And I will destroy your [a]high places and cut down your altars to the sun and heap up your [1]dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols, and My soul will abhor you.',
'26:31': 'And I will make your [a]cities a [1]waste and will make your [b]holy places desolate, and I will not smell the savor of your satisfying fragrances.',
'26:32': 'And I will make the land [1a]desolate, so that your enemies who dwell in it will be astonished at it.',
'26:33': 'You however I will [1a]scatter among the nations, and I will unsheathe the sword after you; and your land will become a desolation, and your cities will become a waste.',
'26:34': 'Then the land will enjoy its [1a]Sabbaths during all the days of desolation while you are in your enemies&rsquo; land; then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths.',
'26:35': 'During all the days of desolation it will have the rest, which it did not have on your Sabbaths when you were dwelling upon it.',
'26:36': 'And as for those who remain among you, I will send faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf will [1]put them to flight; and they will flee as one flees from the sword; and they will fall though [a]no one pursues.',
'26:37': 'And they will stumble over one another, as if fleeing before the sword, though no one pursues; and you will not be able to stand before your enemies.',
'26:38': 'And you will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.',
'26:39': 'And those who are remaining among you will rot away because of their iniquity in your enemies&rsquo; lands; and also because of the iniquities of their fathers they will rot away with them.',
'26:40': 'But if they [1a]confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers, in their unfaithfulness which they committed against Me, and also that they walked contrary to Me,',
'26:41': 'So that I also walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their [a]uncircumcised heart is humbled, and then they accept the punishment of their iniquity;',
'26:42': 'Then I will [1a]remember My covenant with Jacob, and I will remember also My covenant with Isaac and also My covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.',
'26:43': 'For the land will be abandoned by them and will enjoy its [a]Sabbaths while it is desolate without them. And they will accept the punishment of their iniquity because, even because, they rejected My ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes.',
'26:44': 'And yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will [a]not [1]reject them, nor will I abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and to break My covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God.',
'26:45': 'But for their sakes I will [a]remember the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations so that I might be their God; I am Jehovah.',
'26:46': 'These are the statutes and ordinances and laws which Jehovah made between Himself and the children of Israel at Mount Sinai through Moses.',
'27:1': 'Then Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,',
'27:2': 'Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, When a man [1]makes a special [a]vow to Jehovah, it shall be according to your [2]valuation of persons.',
'27:3': 'If your valuation is for the [1]male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver according to the [a]shekel of the sanctuary.',
'27:4': 'And if it is for a [1]female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.',
'27:5': 'And if it is for one aged from [1]five years old even to twenty years old, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels.',
'27:6': 'And if it is for one aged from a [1]month old even to five years old, then your valuation for the male shall be [a]five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.',
'27:7': 'And if it is for one aged from [1]sixty years old and upward, if it is for a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.',
'27:8': 'But if it is for him who is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the [1]means of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him.',
'27:9': 'And if it is for an animal which may be presented to Jehovah as an offering, anything which may be given to Jehovah shall be [1]holy.',
'27:10': 'He may not exchange it or [a]substitute it, either a good one for a bad one or a bad one for a good one; but if he does indeed substitute animal for animal, then both it and its substitute shall be holy.',
'27:11': 'And if his vow is for any [1a]unclean animal, which may not be presented as an offering to Jehovah, then he shall set the animal before the priest,',
'27:12': 'And the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; as you, the priest, value it, so shall it be.',
'27:13': 'But if he ever redeems it, then he shall add [1a]one-fifth of it to your valuation.',
'27:14': 'And if anyone [1]consecrates his house to be holy to Jehovah, then the [2]priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; just as the priest values it, so shall it stand.',
'27:15': 'And if the one who consecrated it redeems his house, then he shall add [1a]one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall become his.',
'27:16': 'And if a man consecrates to Jehovah part of a [1]field of his possession, then your valuation shall be according to the [2]seed needed for it: a homer of barley seed at fifty shekels of silver.',
'27:17': 'If he consecrates his field from the [1]year of jubilee, according to your valuation it shall stand.',
'27:18': 'But if he consecrates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the money [1]for him according to the [a]years which remain until the year of jubilee, and it shall be deducted from your valuation.',
'27:19': 'And if the one who consecrated the field ever redeems it, then he shall [a]add one-fifth of the money of your valuation to it, and it shall revert to him.',
'27:20': 'But if he does not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore.',
'27:21': 'But the [1]field, when it goes out in the [a]jubilee, shall be holy to Jehovah as a [b]devoted field; its possession shall be the priest&rsquo;s.',
'27:22': 'And if he consecrates to Jehovah a field which he has bought that is not part of the field of his possession,',
'27:23': 'Then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation until the year of jubilee, and on that day he shall give your valuation as holy to Jehovah.',
'27:24': 'In the year of jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom he bought it, even to the one to whom the possession of the land belongs.',
'27:25': 'And every valuation of yours shall be according to the [a]shekel of the sanctuary. The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.',
'27:26': 'However no one shall consecrate the [1]firstborn among animals, which as a [a]firstborn already belongs to Jehovah; whether it is an ox or a sheep, it is Jehovah&rsquo;s.',
'27:27': 'But if it is consecrated from among [1a]unclean animals, then he shall ransom it according to your valuation and shall add to it [b]one-fifth of it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your valuation.',
'27:28': 'Nevertheless anything which someone devotes to Jehovah out of all that he has, whether a human or an animal or a field of his possession, it shall not be sold or redeemed. Every devoted thing is [1]most holy to Jehovah.',
'27:29': 'No human beings who are devoted to destruction shall be ransomed; they shall surely be put to death.',
'27:30': 'And all the [a]tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is [1]Jehovah&rsquo;s; it is holy to Jehovah.',
'27:31': 'And if anyone redeems any of his tithe, he shall add to it [a]one-fifth of it.',
'27:32': 'And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatever passes under the shepherd&rsquo;s rod, the tenth one shall be holy to Jehovah.',
'27:33': 'He shall not search whether it is good or bad, nor shall he [a]substitute it; but if he does substitute it at all, then both it and that for which it is substituted shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.',
'27:34': 'These are the commandments which Jehovah commanded Moses on Mount Sinai for the children of Israel.',

Both the tabernacle and the offerings are types of Christ. Through incarnation Christ came to be the tabernacle ({Joh1:14|John 1:14}). This same Christ is also the Lamb of God ({Joh1:29|John 1:29}), the totality, the aggregate, of all the offerings ({Heb10:5|Heb. 10:5}-{Heb10:10|10}).

The offerings signify God in Christ for us to enjoy and even to eat, digest, and assimilate ({Joh6:53|John 6:53}-{Joh6:58|58}) that we may be mingled with God.

The noun form of this word is rendered expiation cover in {Lev16:2|v. 2} and in {Exo25:17|Exo. 25:17}.
