verses: {
'1:1': '[1a]In the beginning was the [2b]Word, and the Word was [3]with God, and the [4]Word was [5c]God.',
'1:2': '[1]He was [2]in the beginning with God.',
'1:3': '[a]All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.',
'1:4': 'In Him was [1a]life, and the life was the [2b]light of men.',
'1:5': 'And the [a]light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.',
'1:6': 'There came a man [1]sent from God, whose name was John.',
'1:7': '[1]He came for a testimony that he might testify concerning the light, that all might believe through him.',
'1:8': 'He was not the light, but <I>came</I> that he might testify concerning the light.',
'1:9': '<I>This</I> was the [a]true light which, coming into the world, [b]enlightens every man.',
'1:10': 'He was in the world, and the world came into being through Him, yet the world did not know Him.',
'1:11': 'He came to His own, yet those who were His own did not receive Him.',
'1:12': 'But as many as [1a]received Him, to them He gave the authority to become [2]children of God, to those who [1]believe into His name,',
'1:13': 'Who were begotten not [1]of [2]blood, nor [1]of the [2]will of the flesh, nor [1]of the [2]will of man, but [1]of God.',
'1:14': 'And the [1]Word became [2a]flesh and [3b]tabernacled among us (and [4c]we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten [5]from the Father), full of [6d]grace and [6e]reality.',
'1:15': 'John testified concerning Him and cried out, saying, This was He of whom I said, [a]He who is coming after me has become ahead of me, because He was before me.',
'1:16': 'For [1]of His [a]fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.',
'1:17': 'For the [1]law was given through Moses; [1a]grace and [1]reality [2]came through Jesus Christ.',
'1:18': 'No one has ever seen God; the [1]only begotten Son, who is [2]in the bosom of the Father, He has [3a]declared <I>Him</I>.',
'1:19': 'And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who are you?',
'1:20': 'And he confessed and did not deny, and he confessed, I am not the [a]Christ.',
'1:21': 'And they asked him, What then? Are you [a]Elijah? And he said, I am not. Are you the [b]Prophet? And he answered, No.',
'1:22': 'They said then to him, Who are you, that we may give an answer to those who sent us? What do you say about yourself?',
'1:23': 'He said, I am a [a]voice of one crying in the wilderness, &ldquo;Make straight the way of the Lord!&rdquo; as Isaiah the prophet said.',
'1:24': 'And those who had been sent were of the Pharisees.',
'1:25': 'And they asked him and said to him, Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?',
'1:26': 'John answered them, saying, I [a]baptize in water; <I>but</I> among you stands One whom you do not know,',
'1:27': 'He who is coming after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.',
'1:28': 'These things took place in [1]Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.',
'1:29': 'The next day he saw Jesus coming to him and said, Behold, the [1a]Lamb of God, who takes away the [b]sin of the [2]world!',
'1:30': 'This is He of whom I said, [a]A man is coming after me who has become ahead of me, because He was before me.',
'1:31': 'And I did not know Him, but in order that He might be manifested to Israel, for this <I>reason</I> I came baptizing in water.',
'1:32': 'And John testified, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a [1a]dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.',
'1:33': 'And I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.',
'1:34': 'And I have seen and have testified that this is the [a]Son of God.',
'1:35': 'Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,',
'1:36': 'And looking at Jesus walking, he said, Behold, the [a]Lamb of God!',
'1:37': 'And the two disciples heard him speak <I>this</I>, and they followed Jesus.',
'1:38': 'And Jesus, turning and beholding them following, said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?',
'1:39': 'He said to them, Come, and you will see. They went therefore and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day; it was about the [1]tenth hour.',
'1:40': 'One of the two who heard <I>this</I> from John and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother.',
'1:41': 'He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the [1]Messiah (which translated means [1]Christ).',
'1:42': 'He led him to Jesus. Looking at him, Jesus said, You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which is interpreted, [1a]Peter).',
'1:43': 'The next day He wanted to go forth into Galilee, and He found Philip. And Jesus said to him, Follow Me.',
'1:44': 'Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.',
'1:45': 'Philip found Nathanael and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the [1]son of Joseph, from Nazareth.',
'1:46': 'And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good be from Nazareth? Philip said to him, [a]Come and see.',
'1:47': 'Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said concerning him, Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!',
'1:48': 'Nathanael said to Him, How do You know me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you.',
'1:49': 'Nathanael answered Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the [1a]King of Israel.',
'1:50': 'Jesus answered and said to him, Is it because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree <I>that</I> you believe? You shall see [a]greater things than these.',
'1:51': 'And He said to him, [1]Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see [2a]heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the [3]Son of Man.',
'2:1': 'And the [1a]third day a [2]wedding took place in [3b]Cana of [4c]Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.',
'2:2': 'And Jesus also was invited, as well as His disciples, to the wedding.',
'2:3': 'And when the [1]wine [2]ran out, the [3]mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.',
'2:4': 'And Jesus said to her, [1]Woman, [2]what do I have in this that concerns you? [a]My hour has not yet come.',
'2:5': 'His mother said to the servants, Whatever He says to you, do.',
'2:6': 'Now there were [1]six stone waterpots lying there, according to the [2]Jews&rsquo; rite of purification, holding [3]two or three measures each.',
'2:7': 'Jesus said to them, Fill the waterpots with [1]water. And they filled them up to the brim.',
'2:8': 'And He said to them, Draw some out now and take it to the master of the feast. And they took <I>it</I> <I>to</I> <I>him</I>.',
'2:9': 'And when the master of the feast tasted the [1a]water which had become wine and did not know where it came from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew, the master of the feast called the bridegroom',
'2:10': 'And said to him, Every man sets out the good wine first, and when they have drunk freely, <I>then</I> that which is worse; you have kept the good wine until now.',
'2:11': 'This [1]beginning of [2a]signs Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee and [3]manifested His glory, and His disciples believed into Him.',
'2:12': 'After this He went down to Capernaum, He and His mother and His brothers and His disciples; and they remained there not many days.',
'2:13': 'And the [a]Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.',
'2:14': 'And [a]He found in the [1b]temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting <I>there</I>.',
'2:15': 'And [1]having made a whip out of [2]cords, He drove them all out of the temple, as well as the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the money of the moneychangers and overturned their tables.',
'2:16': 'And to those who were selling the doves He said, Take these things away from here; do not make [a]My Father&rsquo;s house a house of merchandise.',
'2:17': 'His disciples remembered that it was written, [a]&ldquo;The zeal of Your house shall devour Me.&rdquo;',
'2:18': 'The Jews then answered and said to Him, What sign do You show us, seeing that You do these things?',
'2:19': 'Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this [1]temple, and in [2]three days I will [a]raise it up.',
'2:20': 'Then the Jews said, This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days?',
'2:21': 'But He spoke of the [a]temple of His body.',
'2:22': 'When therefore He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this, and they believed the [a]Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.',
'2:23': 'Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did.',
'2:24': 'But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men,',
'2:25': 'And because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for [a]He Himself knew what was in man.',
'3:1': '[1]But there was a man of the Pharisees named [a]Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.',
'3:2': 'This one came to Him by night and said to Him, Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a [1]teacher, for no one can do these [a]signs that You do unless [b]God is with him.',
'3:3': 'Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is [1a]born anew, he cannot [2]see the [3b]kingdom of God.',
'3:4': 'Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he?',
'3:5': 'Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is [a]born [1]of [2]water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.',
'3:6': 'That which is [a]born [1]of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born [1]of the [2]Spirit is [2]spirit.',
'3:7': 'Do not marvel that I said to you, [1]You must be born anew.',
'3:8': 'The [1a]wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born [2]of the Spirit.',
'3:9': 'Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?',
'3:10': 'Jesus answered and said to him, You are a teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things?',
'3:11': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that which we know and [a]testify of that which we have seen, and yet you do not receive our testimony.',
'3:12': 'If I told you of the [1]things on earth and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you of the [1]things in heaven?',
'3:13': 'And [a]no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the [b]Son of Man, [1]who is in heaven.',
'3:14': 'And as [a]Moses [b]lifted up the [1]serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,',
'3:15': 'That everyone who believes into Him may have [1]eternal life.',
'3:16': 'For God so [a]loved the [1]world that He [b]gave His [c]only begotten Son, that everyone who [2d]believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.',
'3:17': 'For God did not send the Son into the world to [1]condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.',
'3:18': 'He who believes into Him is not [1]condemned; but he who does not believe has been [1]condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of [a]the only begotten Son of God.',
'3:19': 'And this is the [1]condemnation, that the [a]light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil.',
'3:20': 'For everyone who [1]practices evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his works be [2]reproved.',
'3:21': 'But he who does the [1]truth comes to the light, that his works may be manifested that they are wrought in God.',
'3:22': 'After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea, and there He spent some time with them and [a]baptized.',
'3:23': 'And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized;',
'3:24': 'For [a]John had not yet been thrown into prison.',
'3:25': 'There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John&rsquo;s disciples with a Jew about [a]purification.',
'3:26': 'And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you [a]across the Jordan, of whom you have [b]testified, behold, He is [c]baptizing and all are coming to Him.',
'3:27': 'John answered and said, A man cannot receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.',
'3:28': 'You yourselves testify of me that I said, [a]I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him.',
'3:29': '[a]He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full.',
'3:30': 'He must [1]increase, but I <I>must</I> decrease.',
'3:31': '[1a]He who comes from above is above all; he who is [2]from the earth is [2]of the earth and speaks [2]out of the earth. [b]He who comes [2]from heaven is above all.',
'3:32': 'What He has seen and heard, of this He testifies, and [a]no one receives His testimony.',
'3:33': 'He who receives His testimony has sealed that God is true.',
'3:34': 'For He whom God has sent speaks the [1]words of God, for He gives the Spirit not by measure.',
'3:35': '[a]The Father loves the Son and has given all into His hand.',
'3:36': 'He who [a]believes into the Son has eternal life; but he who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him.',
'4:1': 'When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and [a]baptizing more disciples than John',
'4:2': '(Although Jesus Himself did not baptize, but <I>rather</I> His disciples),',
'4:3': 'He left [a]Judea and went away [b]again into Galilee.',
'4:4': 'And He had to pass through Samaria.',
'4:5': 'So He came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, [a]near the piece of land that Jacob gave to Joseph his son;',
'4:6': 'And Jacob&rsquo;s [1]well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied from the journey, sat thus by the [1]well; it was about the [2]sixth hour.',
'4:7': 'There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, Give Me <I>something</I> to drink.',
'4:8': 'For His disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.',
'4:9': 'The Samaritan woman then said to Him, How <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>that</I> You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? ([a]For Jews have no dealings with [1]Samaritans.)',
'4:10': 'Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the [a]gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you [b]living water.',
'4:11': 'The woman said to Him, Sir, You have no bucket, and the well is deep; where then do You get this living water?',
'4:12': 'Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank of it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?',
'4:13': 'Jesus answered and said to her, Everyone who [1]drinks of this water shall thirst again,',
'4:14': 'But whoever [a]drinks of the water that I will give him shall [b]by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into [1c]eternal life.',
'4:15': 'The woman said to Him, Sir, [a]give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw.',
'4:16': 'He said to her, Go, [1]call your husband and come here.',
'4:17': 'The woman answered and said, I do not have a husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I do not have a husband,',
'4:18': 'For you have had [1]five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.',
'4:19': 'The woman said to Him, Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet.',
'4:20': '[1a]Our fathers worshipped [b]in this mountain, yet you say that [c]in Jerusalem is the place where <I>men</I> must worship.',
'4:21': 'Jesus said to her, Woman, believe Me, [a]an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.',
'4:22': '[a]You worship that which you do not know; we worship that which we know, for salvation is of the Jews.',
'4:23': 'But [a]an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father [b]in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him.',
'4:24': '[1]God is [2]Spirit, and those who [3]worship Him must worship [a]in [4]spirit and [5]truthfulness.',
'4:25': 'The woman said to Him, I know that [a]Messiah is coming (He who is called Christ); when He comes, He will declare all things to us.',
'4:26': 'Jesus said to her, [1]I, who speak to you, am <I>He</I>.',
'4:27': 'And at this <I>point</I> His disciples came, and they marveled that He was speaking with a woman; yet no one said, What are You seeking? or, Why are You speaking with her?',
'4:28': 'Then the woman [1]left her waterpot and went away into the city, and said to the people,',
'4:29': 'Come, see a man who told me all that I have done. [1a]Is this not the Christ?',
'4:30': 'They went out of the city and came to Him.',
'4:31': 'In the meantime, the disciples urged Him, saying, Rabbi, eat.',
'4:32': 'But He said to them, [1]I have food to eat that you do not know about.',
'4:33': 'The disciples therefore said to one another, Has anyone brought Him <I>anything</I> to eat?',
'4:34': 'Jesus said to them, My food is [a]to do the will of Him who sent Me and [b]to finish His work.',
'4:35': 'Do you not say that there are yet four months and then the [a]harvest comes? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are already white for harvest.',
'4:36': 'He who reaps receives wages and gathers fruit [1]unto [2]eternal life, in order that he who sows and he who reaps may rejoice together.',
'4:37': 'For in this the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.',
'4:38': 'I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; [1]others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.',
'4:39': 'And many of the Samaritans from that city believed into Him because of the word of the woman who testified, He told me all that I have done.',
'4:40': 'So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to remain with them, and He remained there two days.',
'4:41': 'And many more believed because of His word.',
'4:42': 'And they said to the woman, It is no longer because of your speaking <I>that</I> we believe, for we ourselves have heard and know that this One is truly the [a]Savior of the world.',
'4:43': 'And after the two days He went forth from there into Galilee,',
'4:44': 'For Jesus Himself testified that [a]a prophet has [1]no honor in his own country.',
'4:45': 'Then when He came into Galilee, the Galileans received Him, having seen all that He did in Jerusalem at the feast, for they also went to the feast.',
'4:46': 'He then came again to [1a]Cana of [2]Galilee, where He had [b]made the water wine.<br class="split">And there was a certain royal official, whose son was sick in Capernaum.',
'4:47': 'When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him and asked <I>Him</I> to come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.',
'4:48': 'Jesus therefore said to him, Unless you see [a]signs and wonders, you will by no means believe.',
'4:49': 'The royal official said to Him, Sir, come down before my little child dies.',
'4:50': 'Jesus said to him, Go, your son lives. The man believed the [1]word which Jesus said to him and went his way.',
'4:51': 'And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and said that his child was living.',
'4:52': 'So he asked them the hour in which he got better. They said then to him, Yesterday at the [1]seventh hour the fever left him.',
'4:53': 'Then the father knew that <I>it</I> <I>was</I> in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son lives; and he believed, he and his whole house.',
'4:54': 'Again, this [1a]second sign Jesus performed when He came out of Judea into Galilee.',
'5:1': 'After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.',
'5:2': 'Now there is in Jerusalem near the [1a]Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew [2]Bethesda, having [3]five porticoes.',
'5:3': '[1]In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, <I>and</I> withered, [2]waiting for the moving of the water.',
'5:4': 'For an [1]angel went down from time to time in the pool and [2]stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made [3]well of whatever disease he was being held by.',
'5:5': 'And a certain [1]man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness.',
'5:6': 'When Jesus saw this one lying <I>there</I> and knew that he had already been a long time <I>in</I> <I>that</I> <I>condition</I>, [1]He said to him, Do you want to get well?',
'5:7': 'The sick man answered Him, [1]Sir, [2]I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.',
'5:8': 'Jesus said to him, [a]Rise, take up your [1]mat and walk.',
'5:9': 'And immediately the man [1]became well, and he [2]took up his mat and walked. Now it was the [a]Sabbath on that day;',
'5:10': 'Therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the [a]Sabbath, and [1b]it is not lawful for you to take up your mat.',
'5:11': 'But he answered them, He who made me well, that One said to me, Take up your mat and walk.',
'5:12': 'They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, Take up <I>your</I> <I>mat</I> and walk?',
'5:13': 'But he who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, there being a crowd in that place.',
'5:14': 'After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; [1a]sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you.',
'5:15': 'The man went away and told the Jews that Jesus was the One who made him well.',
'5:16': 'And because of this the Jews persecuted Jesus [1]and [a]sought to kill Him, because He did these things on the Sabbath.',
'5:17': 'But Jesus answered them, My Father is [1]working until now, and I also am working.',
'5:18': 'Because of this therefore the Jews [1]sought all the more to [a]kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath but also called God His own Father, making Himself [2]equal with [b]God.',
'5:19': 'Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, [a]The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner.',
'5:20': 'For [a]the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things that He Himself is doing; and [b]greater works than these He will show Him that you may marvel.',
'5:21': 'For just as the Father [a]raises the dead and gives <I>them</I> life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills.',
'5:22': 'For neither does the Father judge anyone, but He has given all [a]judgment to the Son,',
'5:23': 'In order that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.',
'5:24': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and [a]believes Him who sent Me has [1]eternal life, and does not come into [2]judgment but has [b]passed out of [3]death into life.',
'5:25': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the [1a]dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will [1]live.',
'5:26': 'For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have [a]life in Himself;',
'5:27': 'And He gave Him authority to execute [a]judgment because He is the [1]Son of Man.',
'5:28': 'Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming in which [1]all in the tombs will hear His [a]voice',
'5:29': 'And will come forth: [a]those who have done good, to the [1b]resurrection of life; and those who have [2]practiced evil, to the [3c]resurrection of [4]judgment.',
'5:30': '[a]I can do nothing from Myself; as I hear, I judge, and [b]My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the [c]will of Him who sent Me.',
'5:31': 'If [a]I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is not true.',
'5:32': 'There is another who testifies concerning Me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies concerning Me is true.',
'5:33': 'You have sent <I>people</I> to John, and [a]he has testified to the [1]truth.',
'5:34': 'But <I>it</I> <I>is</I> not from man <I>that</I> I receive My testimony, but I say these things that you may be saved.',
'5:35': 'He was the lamp that was burning and shining, and you were willing to exult for a while in his light.',
'5:36': 'But I have the testimony <I>which</I> <I>is</I> greater than <I>that</I> of John, for the [a]works which the Father has given Me to finish, the works themselves which I do, testify concerning Me that the Father has [1b]sent Me.',
'5:37': 'And the [a]Father who sent Me, He has [1]testified concerning Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor have you seen His form,',
'5:38': 'And you do not have His word abiding in you, for Him whom He sent, this One you do not believe.',
'5:39': 'You [1]search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me.',
'5:40': 'Yet you are not willing to [1]come to Me that you may have life.',
'5:41': 'I do not receive glory from men.',
'5:42': 'But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.',
'5:43': 'I have come [1a]in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.',
'5:44': 'How can you believe when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that is from the only God?',
'5:45': 'Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father; there is one who accuses you: Moses, in whom you have set your hope.',
'5:46': 'For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for [a]he wrote concerning Me.',
'5:47': 'But [a]if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?',
'6:1': 'After these things Jesus went away across the [1]Sea of Galilee, <I>which</I> <I>is</I> <I>the</I> <I>Sea</I> of Tiberias.',
'6:2': 'And a great crowd followed Him, because they saw the [a]signs which He did on those who were sick.',
'6:3': 'And Jesus went up to the [1]mountain and sat there with His disciples.',
'6:4': 'Now the [1a]Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.',
'6:5': '[a]Jesus then lifting up His eyes and seeing that a great crowd was coming toward Him, said to Philip, Where shall we buy bread that these may eat?',
'6:6': 'But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.',
'6:7': 'Philip answered Him, Two hundred [1]denarii worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one may take a little.',
'6:8': 'One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother, said to Him,',
'6:9': 'There is a little boy here who has [1]five [2]barley loaves and [1]two [2]fish; but what are these for so many?',
'6:10': 'Jesus said, Have the people recline. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men reclined, in number about five thousand.',
'6:11': 'Jesus then took the loaves, and when He had given thanks, He distributed to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they wanted.',
'6:12': 'And when they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost.',
'6:13': 'So they gathered <I>them</I> and filled [1]twelve handbaskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over among those who had eaten.',
'6:14': 'The people therefore, seeing the sign which He did, said, This is truly the [a]Prophet who is to come into the world.',
'6:15': 'Then Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and take <I>Him</I> by force [1]to make Him [a]King, [b]withdrew again to the mountain, Himself alone.',
'6:16': 'And when evening fell, His disciples went down to the sea,',
'6:17': 'And they got into a boat and began crossing the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.',
'6:18': 'And because a strong wind was blowing, the [1]sea was churning.',
'6:19': 'Then, when they had rowed about [1]twenty-five or thirty stadia, they saw [2]Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they became frightened.',
'6:20': 'But He said to them, It is I. Do not be afraid.',
'6:21': 'Then they were willing to [1]take Him into the boat; and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.',
'6:22': 'The next day the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there had been no other small boat there except one, and that Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but <I>that</I> His disciples had gone away alone.',
'6:23': 'But other small boats from Tiberias came near to the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.',
'6:24': 'So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.',
'6:25': 'And when they found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, Rabbi, when did You get here?',
'6:26': 'Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, You seek Me not because you have seen signs, but because you ate of the bread and were filled.',
'6:27': '[a]Work not for the food which perishes, but for the [b]food which abides unto [1]eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for Him has the Father, <I>even</I> God, sealed.',
'6:28': 'Then they said to Him, What shall we [1]do that we may [1]work the works of God?',
'6:29': 'Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that you [1]believe into Him whom He has [2]sent.',
'6:30': 'They said then to Him, What [a]sign then will You do that we may see and believe You? What work will You do?',
'6:31': 'Our fathers [a]ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written, [b]&ldquo;He gave them bread out of heaven to eat.&rdquo;',
'6:32': 'Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread out of heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.',
'6:33': 'For the bread of God is He who [1]comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.',
'6:34': 'They said therefore to Him, Lord, give us this bread always.',
'6:35': 'Jesus said to them, I am the [1]bread of life; he who comes to Me [a]shall [2]by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst.',
'6:36': 'But I have said to you that you have also seen Me, and yet you do not believe.',
'6:37': 'All that the Father [a]gives Me will come to Me, and him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out.',
'6:38': 'For [a]I have come down from heaven [b]not to do My own will but the [c]will of Him who sent Me.',
'6:39': 'And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should [a]lose nothing but should [b]raise it up in the last day.',
'6:40': 'For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who beholds the Son and believes into Him should have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.',
'6:41': 'The Jews therefore murmured concerning Him because He said, I am the bread that [a]came down out of heaven.',
'6:42': 'And they said, [a]Is not this Jesus, the [1]son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, [b]I have come down out of heaven?',
'6:43': 'Jesus answered and said to them, Do not murmur among yourselves.',
'6:44': '[a]No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me [b]draws him; and I will [c]raise him up in the last day.',
'6:45': 'It is written in the prophets, [a]&ldquo;And they shall all be [b]taught of God.&rdquo; Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to Me.',
'6:46': '[a]Not that anyone has seen the Father, except Him who is [1b]from God, He has seen the Father.',
'6:47': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes [a]has eternal life.',
'6:48': 'I am the bread of life.',
'6:49': 'Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.',
'6:50': 'This is the bread which [a]comes down out of heaven, that anyone may [b]eat of it and not die.',
'6:51': 'I am the [1]living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, [a]he shall live forever;<br class="split">And the bread which I will give is My [2]flesh, <I>given</I> [3]for the life of the [b]world.',
'6:52': 'The Jews then contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us His flesh to eat?',
'6:53': 'Jesus therefore said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His [1]blood, you do not have life within yourselves.',
'6:54': 'He who [1]eats My [2]flesh and drinks My [2]blood has eternal life, and I will [a]raise him up in the last day.',
'6:55': 'For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.',
'6:56': 'He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood [a]abides in Me and [1]I in him.',
'6:57': 'As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who [1]eats Me, he also shall [a]live because of Me.',
'6:58': 'This is the bread which came down out of heaven, not as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread [a]shall live forever.',
'6:59': 'He said these things in a synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.',
'6:60': 'Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard <I>this</I>, said, This word is hard; who can hear it?',
'6:61': 'But Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, Does this [a]stumble you?',
'6:62': 'Then what if you saw the Son of Man [1a]ascending to where He was before?',
'6:63': '[a]It is the [1]Spirit who gives life; the [2]flesh profits nothing; the [3]words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.',
'6:64': 'But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus [a]knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe and [b]who was the one who would [1]betray Him.',
'6:65': 'And He said, For this <I>reason</I> I have told you that [a]no one can come to Me unless it has been [b]given to him from the Father.',
'6:66': 'From that time many of His disciples went back to what <I>they</I> <I>left</I> behind and no longer walked with Him.',
'6:67': 'Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Do you also want to go away?',
'6:68': 'Simon Peter answered Him, Lord, to whom shall we go? You have [a]words of eternal life,',
'6:69': 'And we have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.',
'6:70': 'Jesus answered them, <I>Was</I> <I>it</I> not I <I>who</I> [a]chose you, the twelve? Yet one of you is [b]a devil.',
'6:71': 'Now He spoke of Judas, <I>the</I> <I>son</I> of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, would betray Him.',
'7:1': 'And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for He would not walk in Judea, because the Jews were [a]seeking to [1]kill Him.',
'7:2': 'Now the Jews&rsquo; [1a]Feast of Tabernacles was near.',
'7:3': 'His brothers therefore said to Him, Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may behold Your works which You are doing;',
'7:4': 'For no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be <I>known</I> openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world.',
'7:5': 'For not even His brothers believed into Him.',
'7:6': 'Jesus therefore said to them, My [1a]time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.',
'7:7': 'The [a]world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify concerning it, that [b]its works are evil.',
'7:8': 'You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My [a]time has not yet been fulfilled.',
'7:9': 'And having said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.',
'7:10': 'But when His brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, [1]not openly, but as <I>it</I> <I>were</I> in secret.',
'7:11': 'The Jews therefore [a]sought Him at the feast and said, Where is He?',
'7:12': 'And there was much murmuring about Him among the crowds: [a]some said, He is a good man; but others said, No; rather He leads the crowd astray.',
'7:13': 'Yet no one spoke openly about Him for [a]fear of the Jews.',
'7:14': 'But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.',
'7:15': 'The Jews therefore marveled and said, How does this man know letters, [1]without ever having studied?',
'7:16': 'Jesus therefore answered them and said, [a]My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me.',
'7:17': 'If anyone resolves to do His will, he will know concerning the teaching, whether it is of God or whether I speak from Myself.',
'7:18': 'He who speaks from himself [a]seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of Him who sent Him, this One is true, and unrighteousness is not in Him.',
'7:19': '[a]Has not Moses given you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you [b]seek to kill Me?',
'7:20': 'The crowd answered, You [a]have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?',
'7:21': 'Jesus answered and said to them, I did [a]one work, and you all marvel.',
'7:22': 'For the same reason [a]Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.',
'7:23': 'If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with Me because I [a]made an entire man well on the Sabbath?',
'7:24': 'Do not judge according to [1]appearance, but judge the righteous judgment.',
'7:25': 'Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, Is not this the One whom they are seeking to kill?',
'7:26': 'And look, He is speaking openly, and they say nothing to Him. Have the rulers, perhaps, really recognized that this is the Christ?',
'7:27': 'But we [a]know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.',
'7:28': 'Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, You both [1a]know Me and [1]know where I am from; and [b]I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not [1]know.',
'7:29': 'I [a]know Him, because I am [1b]from Him, and He [2]sent Me.',
'7:30': 'They sought then to [a]seize Him, yet no one laid a hand on Him, because [b]His hour had not yet come.',
'7:31': 'But many out of the crowd believed into Him and said, Will the Christ, when He comes, do more signs than this man has done?',
'7:32': 'The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent attendants to arrest Him.',
'7:33': 'Jesus therefore said, [a]I am still with you a little while, and <I>then</I> [b]I am going to Him who sent Me.',
'7:34': '[a]You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come.',
'7:35': 'The Jews then said to one another, Where is this man about to go that we will not find Him? Is He about to go to the <I>Jews</I> <I>in</I> dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?',
'7:36': 'What is the word which He said, You will seek Me and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come?',
'7:37': 'Now on the [1]last day, the great <I>day</I> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone [a]thirsts, let him [b]come to Me and [c]drink.',
'7:38': 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his [a]innermost being shall [1]flow [2b]rivers of living water.',
'7:39': 'But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for <I>the</I> [1a]Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been [b]glorified.',
'7:40': '<I>Some</I> of the crowd therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is truly the [a]Prophet.',
'7:41': 'Others said, This is the [a]Christ. But some said, Does then the Christ come out of [1b]Galilee?',
'7:42': 'Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the [a]seed of David and from [b]Bethlehem, the village where David was?',
'7:43': 'So there arose a division among the crowd because of Him.',
'7:44': 'And some of them wanted to seize Him, but no one laid hands on Him.',
'7:45': 'The attendants therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and these said to them, Why did you not bring Him?',
'7:46': 'The attendants answered, [a]Never has a man spoken as this man <I>has</I>.',
'7:47': 'The Pharisees then answered them, Have you also been deceived?',
'7:48': 'Has any one of the [a]rulers or Pharisees believed into Him?',
'7:49': 'But this crowd which does not know the law is accursed.',
'7:50': '[a]Nicodemus said to them (he who came to Him before, being one of them),',
'7:51': 'Does our law [1]condemn a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he is doing?',
'7:52': 'They answered and said to him, Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of [a]Galilee.',
'7:53': '[1]And everyone went to his <I>own</I> house.',
'8:1': 'But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.',
'8:2': 'And early in the morning He came again into the temple, and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them.',
'8:3': 'And the scribes and Pharisees brought a [1]woman caught in adultery, and having set her in the midst,',
'8:4': 'They said to Him, Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery, in the very act.',
'8:5': 'Now [a]in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. [1]What then do You say?',
'8:6': 'But they said this to [a]tempt Him, so that they might have <I>reason</I> to accuse Him. But Jesus [1]stooped down and wrote with His finger on the ground.',
'8:7': 'But when they persisted in questioning Him, He stood up and said to them, He who is without sin among you, [a]let him <I>be</I> <I>the</I> first to throw a stone at her.',
'8:8': 'And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.',
'8:9': 'And when they heard <I>that</I>, they went out one by one, beginning with the older ones. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman <I>stood</I> where she was, in the midst.',
'8:10': 'And Jesus stood up and said to her, Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?',
'8:11': 'And she said, No one, [1]Lord. And Jesus said, [2a]Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on [b]sin no more.',
'8:12': 'Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the [a]light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the [1b]light of life.',
'8:13': 'The Pharisees then said to Him, You are [a]testifying concerning Yourself; Your testimony is not true.',
'8:14': 'Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I testify concerning Myself, My testimony is true, for I know [a]where I came from and where I am going; but [b]you do not know where I come from or where I am going.',
'8:15': '[a]You [1]judge according to the flesh; I [1]judge no one.',
'8:16': 'But even if I do [a]judge, My judgment is true, for I am not alone, but [1]I [b]and the Father who sent Me.',
'8:17': 'And [a]in your law also it has been written that the testimony of two men is true:',
'8:18': 'I am One who testifies concerning Myself, and the Father who sent Me testifies concerning Me.',
'8:19': 'They said then to Him, Where is Your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither Me nor My Father; [a]if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.',
'8:20': 'These words He spoke in the treasury as He taught in the temple; and no one seized Him, because His [a]hour had not yet come.',
'8:21': 'He said therefore again to them, I am going away, and [a]you will seek Me and will [b]die in your sin. Where I am going, you cannot come.',
'8:22': 'The Jews then said, He is not going to kill Himself, is He, for He says, Where I am going, you cannot come?',
'8:23': 'And He said to them, [a]You are [1]from below, I am [1]from above; you are [1b]of this world, [c]I am not [1]of this world.',
'8:24': 'Therefore I said to you that you will [a]die in your sins; for unless you believe that [1b]I am, you will [a]die in your sins.',
'8:25': 'They said then to Him, Who are You? Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also [1]tell you.',
'8:26': 'I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but [a]He who sent Me is true, and what I have heard from Him, these things I speak to the world.',
'8:27': 'They did not understand that He was speaking to them of the Father.',
'8:28': 'Jesus therefore said to them, When you [1a]lift up the Son of Man, [b]then you will know that [c]I am, and <I>that</I> [d]I do nothing from Myself, but as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things.',
'8:29': 'And He who sent Me is [a]with Me; He has not left Me alone, for I always do the things that are pleasing to Him.',
'8:30': 'As He spoke these things, many believed into Him.',
'8:31': 'Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, If you [a]abide in My word, you are truly My disciples;',
'8:32': 'And you shall know the [1a]truth, and the [1]truth shall [b]set you free.',
'8:33': 'They answered Him, We are [a]Abraham&rsquo;s seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone. How <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>that</I> You say, You shall become free?',
'8:34': 'Jesus answered them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Everyone who commits sin is a [a]slave of sin.',
'8:35': 'And the slave does not abide in the house forever; the son does abide forever.',
'8:36': 'If therefore the Son [a]sets you free, you shall be free indeed.',
'8:37': 'I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s seed; but you [a]seek to kill Me because My word has no place in you.',
'8:38': '[a]I speak the things which I have seen with My Father; so then, you also do the things which you have heard from [b]your father.',
'8:39': 'They answered and said to Him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus said to them, If you were [a]Abraham&rsquo;s children, you would do the works of Abraham.',
'8:40': 'But now you are [a]seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; Abraham did not do this.',
'8:41': 'You do the works of [a]your father. They then said to Him, We were not born of fornication; we have [b]one Father, God.',
'8:42': 'Jesus said to them, If God were your Father you would love Me; for [a]I came forth out from God and have come <I>from</I> <I>Him</I>; for [b]I have not come of Myself, but He [1]sent Me.',
'8:43': 'Why do you not understand My speaking? It is because you cannot hear My word.',
'8:44': '[a]You are of <I>your</I> [1]father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a [b]murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no [c]truth in him. When he speaks the lie, [d]he speaks <I>it</I> out of his own [2]<I>possessions</I>; for he is a liar and the [3]father of it.',
'8:45': 'But because I speak the [a]truth, you do not believe Me.',
'8:46': 'Which of you convicts Me of sin? Since I speak truth, why do you not believe Me?',
'8:47': 'He who is of God hears the [1]words of God; for this <I>reason</I> you do not hear <I>them</I>, because you are not of God.',
'8:48': 'The Jews answered and said to Him, Have we not spoken well <I>in</I> <I>saying</I> that You are a [a]Samaritan and [b]have a demon?',
'8:49': 'Jesus answered, I do not have a demon, but I honor My Father, and you [a]dishonor Me.',
'8:50': 'But [a]I do not seek My glory; there is One who seeks <I>glory</I> <I>for</I> <I>Me</I> and judges.',
'8:51': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, If anyone [a]keeps My word, he shall by no means see [1b]death forever.',
'8:52': 'The Jews therefore said to Him, Now we know that You [a]have a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets <I>too</I>; yet You say, If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means [b]taste death forever.',
'8:53': 'Are You greater than our father Abraham, who died? The prophets died too. Who are You making Yourself?',
'8:54': 'Jesus answered, [a]If I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is [b]My Father who glorifies Me, of whom you say that He is your God.',
'8:55': 'Yet [a]you have not [1]known Him, but [b]I [1]know Him. And if I say that I do not know Him, I will be like you, [c]a liar; but I do know Him and I keep His word.',
'8:56': 'Your father Abraham exulted that he would see My day, and he saw <I>it</I> and rejoiced.',
'8:57': 'The Jews then said to Him, You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?',
'8:58': 'Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, [a]Before Abraham came into being, [1b]I am.',
'8:59': 'So they [a]picked up stones to throw at Him, but Jesus was hidden and went out of the temple.',
'9:1': 'And as He passed by, He saw [1]a man [2]blind from birth.',
'9:2': 'And His disciples asked Him, saying, Rabbi, [1]who sinned, this man or his parents, that he would be born blind?',
'9:3': 'Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but <I>he</I> <I>was</I> <I>born</I> <I>so</I>, that the works of God might be manifested in him.',
'9:4': 'We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is [a]day; night is coming when no one can work.',
'9:5': 'While I am in the world, I am the [a]light of the world.',
'9:6': 'When He had said this, He [a]spat on the ground and made clay of the [1]spittle and anointed his eyes with the clay,',
'9:7': 'And He said to him, Go, [1]wash in the pool of [a]Siloam (which is interpreted, [2]Sent). [3]He went therefore and washed and came <I>away</I> seeing.',
'9:8': 'The neighbors then and those who previously saw him as a beggar said, Is not this the one who used to sit and beg?',
'9:9': 'Some said, This is he. Others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am <I>the</I> <I>one</I>.',
'9:10': 'They said then to him, How then were your eyes opened?',
'9:11': 'He answered, The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the <I>pool</I> of Siloam and wash. I went therefore and washed, and I received my sight.',
'9:12': 'And they said to him, Where is He? He said, I do not know.',
'9:13': 'They brought him who was once blind to the Pharisees.',
'9:14': 'Now it was the [1a]Sabbath, on which day Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.',
'9:15': '[a]Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.',
'9:16': 'Then some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because He does [a]not keep the Sabbath. But others said, How can a man <I>who</I> <I>is</I> a sinner do such [b]signs? And there was [c]a division among them.',
'9:17': 'Then they said to the blind man again, What do you say about Him, in that He opened your eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.',
'9:18': 'The Jews then did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him who had received his sight',
'9:19': 'And asked them, saying, Is this your son, of whom you say that he was born blind? How then does he now see?',
'9:20': 'Then his parents answered <I>them</I> and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.',
'9:21': 'But how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age; he will speak for himself.',
'9:22': 'His parents said these things because they [a]feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed Him <I>to</I> <I>be</I> <I>the</I> Christ, he should be [b]put out of the synagogue.',
'9:23': 'Because of this his parents said, He is of age; question him.',
'9:24': 'Therefore a second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, [a]Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.',
'9:25': 'Then he answered, Whether <I>or</I> <I>not</I> He is a sinner, I do not know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.',
'9:26': 'They said then to him, What did He do to you? How did He open your eyes?',
'9:27': 'He answered them, [a]I told you already and you did not hear. Why do you want to hear <I>it</I> again? Do you also want to become His disciples?',
'9:28': 'And they reviled him and said, You are His disciple; but [a]we are disciples of Moses.',
'9:29': 'We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, [a]we do not know where He is from.',
'9:30': 'The man answered and said to them, Why here is an amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and <I>yet</I> He opened my eyes!',
'9:31': '[a]We know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone is God-fearing and does His will, He hears him.',
'9:32': '[1]Since time began it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one born blind.',
'9:33': '[a]If this man were not [1]from God, He could do nothing.',
'9:34': 'They answered and said to him, You were wholly born in [a]sins, and you are teaching us? And they [1b]cast him out.',
'9:35': 'Jesus heard that they had [a]cast him out, and He found him and said, Do you believe into the [1]Son of God?',
'9:36': 'He answered and said, And who is He, [a]Lord, that I may believe into Him?',
'9:37': 'Jesus said to him, You have both seen Him, and [a]He is the One speaking with you.',
'9:38': 'And he said, Lord, I believe; and he [a]worshipped Him.',
'9:39': 'And Jesus said, For [a]judgment I have come into this world, that [b]those who do not see may see, and that [c]those who see may become blind.',
'9:40': '<I>Some</I> of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these things and said to Him, We are not [a]blind also, are we?',
'9:41': 'Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you would [a]not have sin; but now <I>that</I> you say, We see; your sin remains.',
'10:1': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, He who does not enter through the [1a]door into the [2]sheepfold, but climbs up from somewhere else, he is a [3b]thief and a robber;',
'10:2': 'But he who enters through the [a]door is the [b]shepherd of the sheep.',
'10:3': 'To him the doorkeeper opens, and the [1]sheep [a]hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them [b]out.',
'10:4': 'When he puts forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep [a]follow him because they know his [b]voice.',
'10:5': 'But they will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.',
'10:6': 'This [a]parable Jesus spoke to them, but they did not know what those things meant that He spoke to them.',
'10:7': 'Jesus therefore said to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you that I am the [a]door of the sheep.',
'10:8': 'All who came before Me are [a]thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.',
'10:9': 'I am the [1a]door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved and shall go in and go out and shall find [2]pasture.',
'10:10': 'The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may [a]have [1]life and may have <I>it</I> abundantly.',
'10:11': 'I am the good [a]Shepherd; the good Shepherd [b]lays down His [1]life for the sheep.',
'10:12': 'He who is a hireling and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and scatters <I>them</I>.',
'10:13': '<I>He</I> <I>flees</I> because he is a hireling and it does not matter to him concerning the sheep.',
'10:14': 'I am the good [a]Shepherd, and [b]I know My own, and [c]My own know Me,',
'10:15': 'Even as the [a]Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I [b]lay down My life for the sheep.',
'10:16': 'And I have [1a]other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must lead them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be [2b]one flock, one [c]Shepherd.',
'10:17': 'For this <I>reason</I> the [a]Father loves Me, because [b]I lay down My life that I may take it again.',
'10:18': 'No one takes it away from Me, but I [a]lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to [b]take it again. This commandment I received from My Father.',
'10:19': '[a]A division again took place among the Jews because of these words.',
'10:20': 'And many of them said, He [a]has a demon and is [b]insane. Why do you listen to Him?',
'10:21': 'Others said, These are not the words of one <I>who</I> <I>is</I> demon-possessed. Can a demon [a]open the eyes of the blind?',
'10:22': 'At that time the [1]Feast of the Dedication occurred in Jerusalem, <I>and</I> it was winter.',
'10:23': 'And Jesus was walking in the temple in the [a]portico of Solomon.',
'10:24': 'The Jews therefore surrounded Him and said to Him, How long will You hold our soul in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us [a]plainly.',
'10:25': 'Jesus answered them, I told you, and you do not believe. The [a]works which I do [1]in My Father&rsquo;s name, these testify concerning Me;',
'10:26': 'But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep.',
'10:27': 'My sheep [a]hear My voice, and [b]I know them, and they [c]follow Me;',
'10:28': 'And I give to them [1a]eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and [b]no one shall [c]snatch them out of [1]My hand.',
'10:29': 'My Father, who has given <I>them</I> to Me, is greater than all, and no one can [a]snatch <I>them</I> out of My [1]Father&rsquo;s hand.',
'10:30': '[1]I and the Father are [a]one.',
'10:31': 'The Jews again [a]took up stones that they might stone Him.',
'10:32': 'Jesus answered them, I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of these works are you stoning Me?',
'10:33': 'The Jews answered Him, We are not stoning You for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because You, being a man, are making Yourself [a]God.',
'10:34': 'Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, &ldquo;I said, [a]You are gods&rdquo;?',
'10:35': 'If He said they <I>were</I> gods, to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken,',
'10:36': 'Do you say of Him whom the Father [a]has sanctified and [1b]sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, [c]I am the Son of God?',
'10:37': 'If I do not do the [a]works of My Father, do not believe Me;',
'10:38': 'But if I do <I>them</I>, even if you do not believe Me, [a]believe the works so that you may come to know and continue to know that the [b]Father <I>is</I> in Me and I <I>am</I> in the Father.',
'10:39': 'Then they sought again to [a]seize Him, yet He went forth out of their hand.',
'10:40': 'And [1]He went away again [a]across the Jordan, to the place where John was baptizing at first, and He remained there.',
'10:41': 'And many came to Him and said, John did no sign, but [a]all the things John said concerning this man were true.',
'10:42': 'And [a]many believed into Him there.',
'11:1': 'Now there was a certain man who was sick, Lazarus from [1]Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.',
'11:2': 'It was <I>that</I> Mary who [a]anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.',
'11:3': 'The sisters therefore sent to Him saying, Lord, behold, <I>he</I> whom You love is sick.',
'11:4': 'But when Jesus heard <I>it</I>, He said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the [a]glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified through it.',
'11:5': 'Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.',
'11:6': 'When therefore He heard that he was sick, He remained at that time in the place where He was for two days.',
'11:7': 'Then after this He said to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again.',
'11:8': 'The disciples [1]said to Him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to [a]stone You, and You are going there again?',
'11:9': 'Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the [a]day, he does not stumble, because he sees the [b]light of this world.',
'11:10': 'But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.',
'11:11': 'He said these things, and after this He said to them, Our friend Lazarus has fallen [a]asleep; but I am going that I may wake him out of sleep.',
'11:12': 'The disciples then said to Him, Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will [1]recover.',
'11:13': 'But Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.',
'11:14': 'So Jesus then told them plainly, Lazarus has [1]died.',
'11:15': 'And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe; but let us go to him.',
'11:16': 'Then Thomas, who is called [1]Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with Him.',
'11:17': 'Then when Jesus came, He found that he had already been in the tomb [a]four days.',
'11:18': 'Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about [1]fifteen stadia away.',
'11:19': 'And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.',
'11:20': 'Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went to meet Him; but Mary sat in the house.',
'11:21': 'Then Martha said to Jesus, Lord, [a]if You had been here, my brother would not have died.',
'11:22': 'But even now I know that whatever You ask of God, God will give You.',
'11:23': 'Jesus said to her, Your brother will rise again.',
'11:24': 'Martha said to Him, I know that he will rise again in the [a]resurrection [1]in the last day.',
'11:25': 'Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the [a]life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall [b]live;',
'11:26': 'And everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by [a]no means die forever. Do you believe this?',
'11:27': 'She said to Him, Yes, Lord; I have [1]believed that [a]You are the Christ, the Son of God, He who [b]comes into the world.',
'11:28': 'And when she had said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here and [1]is calling you.',
'11:29': 'And she, when she heard <I>this</I>, rose quickly and came to Him.',
'11:30': 'Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met Him.',
'11:31': 'The Jews then who were with her in the house and were consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to [1]weep there.',
'11:32': 'Then Mary, when she came to where Jesus was, saw Him and fell at His feet, saying to Him, Lord, [a]if You had been here, my brother would not have died.',
'11:33': 'Then Jesus, when He saw her [1]weeping and the [a]Jews who came with her [1]weeping, was [b]moved with indignation in His spirit and was [c]troubled,',
'11:34': 'And He said, Where have you put him? They said to Him, Lord, come and see.',
'11:35': 'Jesus [1]wept.',
'11:36': 'The Jews then said, Behold how He [a]loved him!',
'11:37': 'But some of them said, Could not He who [a]opened the eyes of the blind man also have caused that this man would not die?',
'11:38': 'Jesus therefore, moved with indignation again in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.',
'11:39': 'Jesus said, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him who was deceased, said to Him, Lord, by now he smells, for <I>it</I> <I>is</I> the [a]fourth day <I>that</I> he is <I>there</I>.',
'11:40': 'Jesus said to her, Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the [a]glory of God?',
'11:41': 'Then they [1]took the stone away. And Jesus [a]lifted up His eyes and said, [b]Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.',
'11:42': 'And I knew that You always hear Me; but because of the crowd standing around, I said <I>it</I>, that they may [a]believe that You have [1]sent Me.',
'11:43': 'And when He had said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come out!',
'11:44': 'And he who had died came out, [a]bound hand and foot with cloths, and [b]his face was bound about with a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Loose him and let him go.',
'11:45': 'Many of the [a]Jews therefore who had come to Mary and beheld the things that He did believed into Him.',
'11:46': 'But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them the things that Jesus did.',
'11:47': 'Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled a council and said, What do we do? For this man is doing many [a]signs.',
'11:48': 'If we let Him do so, all will believe into Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and <I>our</I> nation.',
'11:49': 'But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, who was [a]high priest that year, said to them, You know nothing at all,',
'11:50': 'Nor do you take account <I>of</I> <I>the</I> <I>fact</I> that [a]it is expedient for you that one man die for the people and <I>that</I> not the whole nation perish.',
'11:51': 'But this he did not say from himself, but being [a]high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation,',
'11:52': 'And not for the nation only, but that He might also [1]gather into [a]one the children of God who are scattered abroad.',
'11:53': 'From that day therefore they [a]took counsel to kill Him.',
'11:54': 'Jesus therefore no longer [a]walked openly among the Jews, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim, and there He remained with the disciples.',
'11:55': 'Now the [a]Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the Passover in order to [b]purify themselves.',
'11:56': 'They then sought Jesus, and said to one another as they stood in the temple, What do you think? That He will not, by any means, come to the feast?',
'11:57': 'Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where He was, he should disclose it, so that they might arrest Him.',
'12:1': 'Then Jesus, six days before the [a]Passover, came to [1b]Bethany, where Lazarus was, [c]whom Jesus had raised from the dead.',
'12:2': 'Therefore they made Him a supper there; and [a]Martha served, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining <I>at</I> <I>table</I> with Him.',
'12:3': 'Then [a]Mary took a [1]pound of ointment, of very valuable pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair; and the [2]house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.',
'12:4': 'But [a]Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was about to betray Him, said,',
'12:5': 'Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred [1]denarii and given to the poor?',
'12:6': 'But he said this not because it mattered to him concerning the poor, but because he was a thief, and [a]holding the purse, carried off what was put into <I>it</I>.',
'12:7': 'Then [1]Jesus said, Leave her alone; she has reserved it for the day of My burial.',
'12:8': '[a]For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have Me.',
'12:9': 'Then a great crowd of the Jews found out that He was there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that they might also see Lazarus, [a]whom He had raised from the dead.',
'12:10': 'And the chief priests took counsel to kill Lazarus also,',
'12:11': 'Because on account of him [a]many of the Jews went away and believed into Jesus.',
'12:12': 'On the next day, [a]the great crowd who had come to the [b]feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,',
'12:13': 'Took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and cried out, [1]Hosanna! [a]Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the [b]King of Israel!',
'12:14': 'And Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, as it is written,',
'12:15': '[a]&ldquo;Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King comes, sitting on a donkey&rsquo;s colt.&rdquo;',
'12:16': 'These things His disciples did not understand at first, but when Jesus was [a]glorified, then they [b]remembered that these things were written of Him and <I>that</I> they had done these things to Him.',
'12:17': 'The crowd therefore that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead testified.',
'12:18': 'For this <I>reason</I> the crowd also went and met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.',
'12:19': 'The Pharisees then said to one another, You see that you are not doing anything worthwhile; behold, the world has gone after Him.',
'12:20': 'And there were some Greeks among those who went up to [a]worship at the feast.',
'12:21': 'These then came to [a]Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.',
'12:22': 'Philip came and told Andrew; Andrew came, and Philip <I>too</I>, and they told Jesus.',
'12:23': 'And Jesus answered them, saying, The [a]hour has come for the Son of Man to be [1b]glorified.',
'12:24': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, [a]Unless the grain of wheat [1]falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears [2b]much fruit.',
'12:25': '[a]He who loves his [1b]soul-life loses it; and he who [c]hates his [1b]soul-life in this world shall keep it unto [2]eternal life.',
'12:26': 'If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also My servant will be. If anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.',
'12:27': 'Now is [a]My [1]soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, [b]save Me out of this [c]hour. But for [2]this <I>reason</I> I have come to this hour.',
'12:28': 'Father, [1a]glorify Your name. Then a [b]voice came out of heaven: I have both [1a]glorified <I>it</I> and will [1a]glorify <I>it</I> again.',
'12:29': 'The crowd therefore which stood by and heard <I>it</I> said that there had been thunder; others said, [a]An angel has spoken to Him.',
'12:30': 'Jesus answered and said, This voice has not [1]come for My sake, but for your sake.',
'12:31': 'Now is the [1a]judgment of this [2]world; now shall the [b]ruler of this world be cast out.',
'12:32': 'And I, if I be [1a]lifted up from the earth, will [b]draw [c]all men to Myself.',
'12:33': 'But He said this [a]signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.',
'12:34': 'The crowd therefore answered Him, We have heard out of the law that the [a]Christ abides forever; and how <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>that</I> You say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?',
'12:35': 'Jesus then said to them, The light is [a]still among you a little while. Walk while you have the light so that darkness may not [b]overcome you; and he who [c]walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.',
'12:36': 'While you have the [a]light, believe into the light, so that you may become [b]sons of light.<br class="split">Jesus said these things, and He went away and [c]was hidden from them.',

'12:39': 'For this <I>reason</I> they could not believe, because again Isaiah said,',

'12:41': 'These things said Isaiah because he [a]saw [1]His glory and spoke concerning Him.',
'12:42': 'Nevertheless even many of the rulers believed into Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess <I>Him</I>, [a]so that they would not be [b]put out of the synagogue;',
'12:43': 'For they loved the [a]glory of men more than the [a]glory of God.',

'13:24': 'Simon Peter therefore nodded to him to inquire who it might be about whom He was speaking.',
'13:25': 'Then he, while reclining thus on Jesus&rsquo; breast, said to Him, Lord, who is it?',
'13:26': 'Jesus answered, It is he for whom I will dip the morsel and to whom I will give <I>it</I>. And dipping the morsel, He gave <I>it</I> to Judas Iscariot, <I>the</I> <I>son</I> of Simon.',
'13:27': 'And at that moment, after the morsel, [a]Satan entered into him. Jesus therefore said to him, What you do, do quickly.',
'13:28': 'But none of those reclining <I>at</I> <I>table</I> knew why He said this to him.',
'13:29': 'For some supposed, since Judas held the purse, that Jesus was saying to him, Buy the things that we have need of for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.',
'13:30': 'Therefore having taken the morsel, he went out immediately; and it was night.',
'13:31': 'Then when he went out, Jesus said, Now has the Son of Man been [1a]glorified, and God has been [2b]glorified in Him.',

'13:37': 'Peter said to Him, Lord, why can&rsquo;t I follow You now? I will lay down my [1]life for You.',
'13:38': 'Jesus answered, Will you lay down your life for Me? Truly, truly, I say to you, A [a]rooster shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times.',

'19:7': 'The Jews answered him, We have a [a]law, and according to that law He ought to die because He [b]made Himself the Son of God.',
'19:8': 'When Pilate therefore heard this word, he became frightened the more,',
'19:9': 'And he entered into the [1]praetorium again and said to Jesus, Where are You from? But Jesus gave him no answer.',
'19:10': 'Therefore Pilate said to Him, You do not speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and I have authority to crucify You?',
'19:11': 'Jesus answered him, You would have no authority against Me if it were not [a]given to you from above; for this <I>reason</I>, he who has delivered Me to you has the greater sin.',
'19:12': 'From then on, Pilate sought to release Him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If you release this man, you are not a friend of Caesar; everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.',
'19:13': 'Pilate therefore, when he heard these words, brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called the Pavement, but in Hebrew, [1]Gabbatha.',
'19:14': 'Now it was the <I>day</I> <I>of</I> [1]preparation for the Passover; it was about the [2]sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, Behold, your King!',
'19:15': 'They cried out then, Take <I>Him</I> away! Take <I>Him</I> away! Crucify Him! Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king except Caesar.',
'19:16': 'Therefore at that time he delivered Him to them that [1]He might be crucified. Therefore they [a]took Jesus.',
'19:17': 'And [a]bearing the cross for Himself, He went out to the <I>place</I> called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,',
'19:18': 'Where they crucified Him, and with Him [a]two others, on this side and that, and Jesus in the middle.',
'19:19': 'And Pilate wrote a notice also and put <I>it</I> on the cross; and it was written, JESUS THE [a]NAZARENE, THE [b]KING OF THE JEWS.',
'19:20': 'This notice therefore many of the Jews read, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in [1]Hebrew, in [1]Latin, <I>and</I> in [1]Greek.',
'19:21': 'The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The King of the Jews, but that He said, I am the King of the Jews.',
'19:22': 'Pilate answered, [1]What I have written, I have written.',
'19:23': 'The soldiers then, when they had crucified Jesus, [1a]took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier, <I>and</I> <I>they</I> <I>took</I> the [2]tunic as well. But the [2]tunic was seamless, woven from the top throughout.',
'19:24': 'They said therefore to one another, Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it <I>to</I> <I>see</I> whose it shall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, [a]&ldquo;They divided My garments among themselves, and for My clothing they cast lots.&rdquo; So then the soldiers [1]did these things.',
'19:25': 'And there were standing by the cross of Jesus His mother and His mother&rsquo;s [1]sister <I>and</I> Mary the <I>wife</I> of Clopas and [a]Mary the Magdalene.',
'19:26': 'Then Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, [a]Woman, [1]behold, your son.',
'19:27': 'Then He said to the disciple, [1]Behold, your mother. And from that hour the disciple took her into his own <I>home</I>.',
'19:28': 'After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had now been finished <I>and</I> so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, [a]I [1b]thirst.',
'19:29': 'There was lying <I>there</I> a vessel full of vinegar; therefore, they put a sponge full of vinegar on hyssop and brought it to His mouth.',
'19:30': 'Then when Jesus had taken the [1]vinegar, He said, It is [2]finished! And He bowed His head and delivered up His spirit.',
'19:31': 'Then the Jews, since it was the <I>day</I> <I>of</I> preparation <I>and</I> so that the bodies might not [a]remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath day was a great <I>Sabbath)</I>, requested of Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.',
'19:32': 'The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other man who had been crucified with Him.',
'19:33': 'But coming to Jesus, when they saw that He had already died, they did not break His legs;',
'19:34': 'But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out [1a]blood and [1b]water.',
'19:35': 'And he who has seen <I>this</I> has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he says what is true, that you also may believe.',
'19:36': 'For [1]these things happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled: [a]&ldquo;No [2]bone of His shall be broken.&rdquo;',
'19:37': 'And again another Scripture says, [a]&ldquo;They shall look on Him whom they [b]pierced.&rdquo;',
'19:38': 'And [1a]after these things Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but a hidden one for fear of the Jews, requested of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus away; and Pilate allowed <I>it</I>. He came therefore and took His body away.',
'19:39': 'And [a]Nicodemus, he who had come to Him the first time by night, came also, bringing a mixture of [b]myrrh and [c]aloes of about a hundred [1]pounds.',
'19:40': 'Therefore they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the custom of the Jews for burying.',
'19:41': 'Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new [a]tomb, in which no one had ever yet been laid.',
'19:42': 'Therefore because of the <I>day</I> <I>of</I> preparation for the Jews <I>and</I> because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus there.',
'20:1': '[a]Now on the [1b]first [c]day of the week, Mary the Magdalene [2]came early to the tomb while it was yet dark and saw the stone taken away from the tomb.',
'20:2': 'She ran therefore and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and said to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him.',
'20:3': 'Peter therefore went forth, as well as the other disciple, and came to the tomb.',
'20:4': 'And the two ran together, yet the other disciple ran ahead faster <I>than</I> Peter and came first to the tomb.',
'20:5': 'And stooping to look in, he saw the [1]linen cloths lying <I>there</I>; however, he did not enter.',
'20:6': 'Then Simon Peter also came, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beheld the linen cloths lying <I>there</I>',
'20:7': 'And the [1]handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart.',
'20:8': 'At that time therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, entered, and he saw and believed;',
'20:9': 'For as yet they did not understand the [a]Scripture, that He had to [1b]rise from among the dead.',
'20:10': 'The disciples therefore went away again to their own <I>home</I>.',
'20:11': 'But Mary stood outside at the tomb [1]weeping. Then as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb',
'20:12': 'And beheld two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.',
'20:13': 'And they said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him.',
'20:14': 'When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing <I>there</I>, yet she did not know that it was Jesus.',
'20:15': 'Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away.',
'20:16': 'Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which means Teacher).',
'20:17': 'Jesus said to her, Do not touch Me, for I have not yet [1]ascended to the Father; but go to My [2a]brothers and say to them, I [b]ascend to My [3]Father and your Father, and My God and your God.',
'20:18': 'Mary the Magdalene came, announcing to the disciples, I have seen the Lord, and <I>that</I> He had said these things to her.',
'20:19': '[a]When therefore it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and while the doors were shut where the [1]disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus [2]came and stood in the midst and said to them, [b]Peace be to you.',
'20:20': 'And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. The disciples therefore [1a]rejoiced at [b]seeing the Lord.',
'20:21': 'Then Jesus said to them again, [a]Peace be to you; as the Father has [1]sent Me, I also [2b]send you.',
'20:22': 'And when He had said this, He [a]breathed into <I>them</I> and said to them, [b]Receive the Holy [1c]Spirit.',
'20:23': '[a]Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose <I>sins</I> you retain, they are retained.',
'20:24': 'But Thomas, one of the twelve, called [1]Didymus, [2]was not with them when Jesus came.',
'20:25': 'The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the [a]Lord! But he said to them, Unless I see in His hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into His side, I will by no means believe.',
'20:26': 'And [1]after [a]eight days, His [2]disciples were again within, and Thomas <I>was</I> with them. Jesus [3]came, though the doors were shut, and stood in the midst and said, [b]Peace be to you.',
'20:27': 'Then He said to Thomas, Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put <I>it</I> into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.',
'20:28': 'Thomas answered and said to Him, My [a]Lord and my [1b]God!',
'20:29': 'Jesus said to him, Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.',
'20:30': 'Moreover indeed [a]many other signs also Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book.',
'20:31': 'But these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the [1a]Christ, the [b]Son of God, and that [c]believing, you may have life in His name.',
'21:1': '[1]After these things Jesus [2a]manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He manifested <I>Himself</I> in this way:',
'21:2': 'Simon Peter and [a]Thomas, called [1]Didymus, and [b]Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the [c]<I>sons</I> of Zebedee and two others of His disciples were <I>there</I> together.',
'21:3': 'Simon Peter said to them, I am [1]going [a]fishing. They said to him, We also are coming with you. They went forth and [b]got into the boat, and that night they caught [2]nothing.',
'21:4': 'Now as soon as the morning broke, Jesus stood on the shore; however the disciples did [a]not know that it was Jesus.',
'21:5': 'Then Jesus said to them, [a]Little children, you do not have any [1b]<I>fish</I> to eat, do you? They answered Him, [2]No.',
'21:6': 'And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find <I>some</I>. They cast therefore, and they were no longer able to haul it <I>in</I> because of the [1]abundance of fish.',
'21:7': 'Then that [a]disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! Therefore when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself, for he [1]was naked; and he threw himself into the sea.',
'21:8': 'But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about [1]two hundred cubits away, dragging the net of fish.',
'21:9': 'Then when they got out onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid <I>there</I>, and [1a]fish lying on <I>it</I> and [b]bread.',
'21:10': 'Jesus said to them, Bring <I>some</I> of the fish that you have just now caught.',
'21:11': 'Simon Peter therefore went up and hauled the net to the land full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not torn.',
'21:12': 'Jesus said to them, [1]Come <I>and</I> have breakfast. But none of the disciples dared to inquire of Him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.',
'21:13': 'Jesus came and [a]took the [1]bread and gave <I>it</I> to them, and the [1]fish likewise.',
'21:14': 'This was now the [a]third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after He had been [b]raised from the dead.',
'21:15': 'Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, [1]Simon, <I>son</I> of John, do you [2]love Me [a]more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I [3]love You. He said to him, [4b]Feed My [5]lambs.',
'21:16': 'He said to him again a second time, Simon, <I>son</I> of John, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, [1a]Shepherd My [2]sheep.',
'21:17': 'He said to him the [1]third time, Simon, <I>son</I> of John, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You [2a]know [b]all things; You [2]know that I love You. Jesus said to him, [c]Feed My sheep.',
'21:18': 'Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were younger, you girded yourself and [1a]walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry <I>you</I> where you do not wish <I>to</I> <I>go</I>.',
'21:19': 'Now this He said, [a]signifying by what [1b]kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this, He said to him, [c]Follow Me.',
'21:20': 'Peter, turning around, saw the [a]disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also [b]reclined on His breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You?',
'21:21': 'Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man?',
'21:22': 'Jesus said to him, If I want him to [a]remain until I [1b]come, what <I>is</I> <I>that</I> to you? You [1c]follow Me.',
'21:23': 'This word therefore went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die, yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I [1]come, what <I>is</I> <I>that</I> to you?',
'21:24': 'This is the disciple who [a]testifies concerning these things, and the one who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.',
'21:25': 'And there are also [1a]many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written.',

As the introduction to this Gospel, this chapter begins in eternity past with God, who had divinity but not humanity ({Joh1:1|v. 1}); it then passes through His creation of all things ({Joh1:3|v. 3}), His incarnation ({Joh1:14|v. 14}), His becoming the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world ({Joh1:29|v. 29}), and His being the Spirit who causes the believers to be transformed into living stones for His building (vv. {Joh1:32|32}, {Joh1:42|42}), and continues all the way to eternity future, in which the Son of Man, who has both divinity and humanity, is the center for the communication between heaven and earth and for the union of God and man in eternity. After this, {Joh2|ch. 2} shows that the principle of the Triune God as life is to change death into life ({Joh2:1|2:1}-{Joh2:11|11}) and that the purpose of life is to build the house, the temple, of God ({Joh2:13|2:13}-{Joh2:22|22}). In chs. {Joh3|3}&mdash;{Joh11|11}, nine cases are given to illustrate how God as life meets the different needs of different kinds of people. As a result, in the beginning of {Joh12|ch. 12} a miniature of the church is produced ({Joh12:1|12:1}-{Joh12:11|11}). From {Joh12:12|12:12} to the end of {Joh17|ch. 17} an explanation is given concerning how the church is produced through the multiplication and increase of the incarnated God-man by means of His death and resurrection. Chapters {Joh18|18}&mdash;{Joh20|20} show the accomplishing of the multiplication and increase, which causes Him to have many brothers ({Joh20:17|20:17}) and enables Him to enter into them ({Joh20:22|20:22}) to be their life and everything that they may be constituted His Body as His increase and expression.

It is the Word who became such flesh, and this Word was God, the complete Triune God ({Joh1:1|v. 1}). That the Word became flesh means that the Triune God became a man of flesh in the likeness of a sinful man. By so doing God entered into sinful man and became one with sinful man. However, He had only the likeness of a sinful man and not the sin of a sinful man. Hence, He was a sinless God-man, the complete God and the perfect man, having two natures, the divine nature and the human nature. Although His two natures were mingled to produce a God-man, the individual characteristics of the two natures remained distinct; the two natures did not intermix to form a third nature. Rather, the divine nature existed in the human nature and was expressed through the human nature, full of grace, which is God enjoyed by man, and reality, which is God obtained by man. In this way the invisible God was expressed so that men can obtain and enjoy Him as their life for the fulfillment of His New Testament economy.","God&rsquo;s becoming flesh was contrary to the teaching of the Gnostics of that time. The Gnostics maintained that since the flesh is an evil substance, God, who is pure, could never be united with the evil flesh. Using the teaching of the Gnostics as a basis, the Docetists denied that Christ had come in the flesh ({1Jo4:2|1&nbsp;John 4:2}). John wrote this Gospel in part to refute the heresy of the Docetists and to prove strongly that Christ, the God-man, is indeed God who became flesh (having only the likeness of the flesh of sin but not the sin of the flesh) that through this flesh, on the one hand, He might destroy the devil ({Heb2:14|Heb. 2:14}) and put away the sins of man ({Heb9:26|Heb. 9:26}), and, on the other hand, God might be united with man and be expressed through humanity for the fulfillment of His glorious purpose, a purpose He planned in eternity past for eternity future.","The deep thought of the Gospel of John is that Christ, the incarnate God, came as the embodiment of God, as illustrated by the tabernacle ({Joh1:14|v. 14}) and the temple ({Joh2:21|2:21}), so that man could contact Him and enter into Him to enjoy the riches contained in God. Both the tabernacle and the temple had an outer court, a Holy Place, and a Holy of Holies. Therefore, John points out first that Christ was the Lamb (who took away sin&mdash;{Joh1:29|v. 29}) offered on the altar, which signifies the cross, in the outer court of the tabernacle, and then that He was like the bronze serpent (which caused man to have life) lifted up on the pole ({Joh3:14|3:14}), which signifies the cross. This shows how Christ in His redemption was received by His believers that they might be delivered from sin and obtain life and might enter into Him as the embodiment of God, typified by the tabernacle, to enjoy all the riches that are in God. The foot-washing in {Joh13|ch. 13} may be considered the washing in the laver in the outer court of the tabernacle, which washed away the earthly defilement of those who drew near to God, so that their fellowship with God and with one another could be maintained. In {Joh14|ch. 14} those who receive Christ are brought by Him into the Holy Place to experience Him as the bread of life ({Joh6:35|6:35}), signified by the showbread, and as the light of life ({Joh8:12|8:12}; {Joh9:5|9:5}), signified by the lampstand. Eventually, in {Joh17|ch. 17}, through the highest and most mysterious prayer, which is typified by the burning incense on the golden incense altar, those who enjoy Christ as life and as light are brought by Him into the Holy of Holies to enter with Him into the deepest enjoyment of God and to enjoy the glory that God has given Him ({Joh17:22|17:22}-{Joh17:24|24})."]},

On the other hand, regeneration terminates the evil nature of Satan in our flesh. In {Gen3|Gen. 3} Satan, the serpent, injected his nature into man&rsquo;s flesh. When the children of Israel sinned against God, they were bitten by serpents ({Num21:4|Num. 21:4}-{Num21:9|9}). God told Moses to lift up a bronze serpent on their behalf for God&rsquo;s judgment, that by looking upon that bronze serpent all might live. That was a type. Here, in this verse, the Lord Jesus applied that type to Himself, indicating that when He was in the flesh, He was in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin&rdquo; ({Rom8:3|Rom. 8:3}), which likeness is equal to the form of the bronze serpent. The bronze serpent had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent&rsquo;s poison. Christ was made in &ldquo;the likeness of the flesh of sin,&rdquo; but He did not participate in any way in the sin of the flesh ({2Co5:21|2&nbsp;Cor. 5:21}; {Heb4:15|Heb. 4:15}). When He was lifted up in the flesh on the cross, by His death Satan, the old serpent, was dealt with ({Joh12:31|12:31}-{Joh12:33|33}; {Heb2:14|Heb. 2:14}). This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man has been dealt with. When a man is regenerated with the divine life in Christ, his satanic nature is annulled. Because of this, in this portion of the Word, when the Lord revealed the matter of regeneration to Nicodemus, He specifically mentioned this point.","Nicodemus might have considered himself a moral and good man. But the Lord&rsquo;s word in this verse implied that regardless of how good Nicodemus might have been outwardly, he had the serpentine nature of Satan inwardly. As a descendant of Adam, he had been poisoned by the old serpent, and the serpent&rsquo;s nature was within him. He needed the Lord not only to be the Lamb of God to take away his sin ({Joh1:29|1:29}) but also to be in the form of the serpent that his serpentine nature might be dealt with on the cross and that he might have eternal life.

In the scene of the Feast of the Passover, the Lord presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man&rsquo;s hunger.

Hence, this feast is a reminder that today people are still in the wilderness and need to enter into the rest of the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal tabernacle ({Rev21:2|Rev. 21:2}-{Rev21:3|3}). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob also lived in tents and looked forward to this eternal tabernacle ({Heb11:9|Heb. 11:9}-{Heb11:10|10}), in which there will be a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to quench man&rsquo;s thirst ({Rev22:1|Rev. 22:1}, {Rev22:17|17}).

The Lord is the ever-existing God, the great I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross to bear our sins; hence, He is qualified to forgive our sins. Furthermore, the Lord, being the eternal God, can come into us to be life and light to deliver us from the bondage and darkness of sin.","The case in this chapter shows also that the religion (represented by the temple&mdash;vv. {Joh8:2|2}, {Joh8:20|20}) of law (vv. {Joh8:5|5}, {Joh8:17|17}) cannot set people free from sin and death; but the Lord Jesus, the I Am, who became the Son of Man and was lifted up on the cross for the serpent-poisoned people, can do what religion and law cannot do. This chapter shows us that Christ, the great I Am, not only is versus sin and death but also is versus religion and law."]},

His incarnation caused His divine glory to be concealed in His flesh. Through His death and resurrection His glory was released, producing many grains, which become His increase as the expression of His glory. What was spoken in vv. {Joh12:23|23}, {Joh12:28|28}; {Joh13:31|13:31}-{Joh13:32|32}; {Joh14:13|14:13}; {Joh15:8|15:8}; {Joh16:14|16:14}; and {Joh17:1|17:1}, {Joh17:4|4}, {Joh17:5|5}, {Joh17:10|10}, {Joh17:22|22}, {Joh17:24|24} is related to this glory. In the Lord&rsquo;s last words to the believers in chs. {Joh14|14}&mdash;{Joh16|16}, there are three concrete, corporate expressions of this glory: the Father&rsquo;s house (the church) in {Joh14:2|14:2}, the branches of the vine (the constituents of the Body of Christ) in {Joh15:1|15:1}-{Joh15:5|5}, and a newborn corporate man (the new man) in {Joh16:21|16:21}. All three denote the church, showing that the church is the glorious increase produced by the glorious Christ through His death and resurrection. In this glorious increase, Christ, the Son of God, is glorified, causing God the Father also to be glorified in Christ&rsquo;s glorification, that is, to be fully expressed through the church ({Eph3:19|Eph. 3:19}-{Eph3:21|21}). This expression needs to be maintained in the oneness of the Triune God. Therefore, the Lord prayed in particular for this matter in His concluding prayer in {Joh17|ch. 17} ({Joh17:20|17:20}-{Joh17:23|23}). This glorious increase of Christ is the peak of the mystery revealed in the Gospel of John, and its ultimate consummation is the New Jerusalem in Revelation, also written by John. The new holy city will be the aggregate of Christ&rsquo;s increase throughout the generations, and in it Christ&rsquo;s divine glory will be expressed to the uttermost. In the glorifying of God the Son, God the Father also will obtain eternal, matchless glory, which will be His full expression in eternity. Thus His eternal economy will be fulfilled for eternity."]},

He was God incarnated in the flesh, and His flesh was a tabernacle in which God could dwell on earth ({Joh1:14|1:14}). His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God&rsquo;s shekinah glory had been concealed within the tabernacle. Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory, being seen by the three disciples ({Mat17:1|Matt. 17:1}-{Mat17:4|4}; {Joh1:14|John 1:14}). But then it was concealed again in His flesh. Before this prayer He predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him ({Joh12:23|12:23}; {Joh13:31|13:31}-{Joh13:32|32}). Now He was about to pass through death so that the concealing shell of His humanity might be broken and His divine element, His divine life, might be released. Also, He would resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed, with the result that His entire being, His divinity and His humanity, would be glorified (see {Joh12:23^1|note 23<sup>1</sup>} in {Joh12|ch. 12}). The Father would thus be glorified in Him (see {Joh12:28^1|note 28<sup>1</sup>} in {Joh12|ch. 12}). Hence, He prayed for this.","The Lord&rsquo;s prayer here concerning the divine mystery is fulfilled in three stages. First, it was fulfilled in His resurrection, in that His divine element, His divine life, was released from within His humanity into His many believers ({Joh12:23|12:23}-{Joh12:24|24}), and His whole being, including His humanity, was brought into glory ({Luk24:26|Luke 24:26}), and in that the Father&rsquo;s divine element was expressed in His resurrection and glorification. In His resurrection God answered and fulfilled His prayer ({Act3:13|Acts 3:13}-{Act3:15|15}). Second, it has been fulfilled in the church, in that as His resurrection life has been expressed through His many members, He has been glorified in them, and the Father has been glorified in Him through the church ({Eph3:21|Eph. 3:21}; {1Ti3:15|1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15}-{1Ti3:16|16}). Third, it will ultimately be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem, in that He will be fully expressed in glory, and God will be glorified in Him through the holy city for eternity ({Rev21:11|Rev. 21:11}, {Rev21:23|23}-{Rev21:24|24}).","In praying in this way, the Lord unveiled His person, His deity; He is the same as the Father in the divine glory."]},

Blood is for redemption, to deal with sins ({Joh1:29|1:29}; {Heb9:22|Heb. 9:22}) for the purchasing of the church ({Act20:28|Acts 20:28}). Water is for imparting life, to deal with death ({Joh12:24|12:24}; {Joh3:14|3:14}-{Joh3:15|15}) for the producing of the church ({Eph5:29|Eph. 5:29}-{Eph5:30|30}). The Lord&rsquo;s death, on the negative side, takes away our sins, and on the positive side, imparts life into us. Hence, it has two aspects: the redemptive aspect and the life-imparting aspect. The redemptive aspect is for the life-imparting aspect. The record of the other three Gospels portrays only the redemptive aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death; John&rsquo;s record portrays not only the redemptive aspect but also the life-imparting aspect. In {Mat27:45|Matt. 27:45}, {Mat27:51|51}, {Mrk15:33|Mark 15:33}, and {Luk23:44|Luke 23:44}-{Luk23:45|45}, darkness, a symbol of sin, appeared, and the veil of the temple, which separated man from God, was rent. These signs are related to the redemptive aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death. The words spoken by the Lord on the cross in {Luk23:34|Luke 23:34}, &ldquo;Father, forgive them,&rdquo; and in {Mat27:46|Matt. 27:46}, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; (because He bore our sin at that time), also depict the redemptive aspect of His death. But the flowing water and the unbroken bone mentioned by John in vv. {Joh19:34|34} and {Joh19:36|36} are signs that relate to the life-imparting aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s death (see {Joh19:26^1|note 26<sup>1</sup>}). This death that imparts life released the Lord&rsquo;s divine life from within Him for the producing of the church, which is composed of all His believers, into whom His divine life has been imparted. This life-imparting death of the Lord&rsquo;s is typified by Adam&rsquo;s sleep, out from which Eve was produced ({Gen2:21|Gen. 2:21}-{Gen2:23|23}), and is signified by the death of the one grain of wheat that fell into the ground for the bringing forth of many grains ({Joh12:24|12:24}) to make the one bread&mdash;the Body of Christ ({1Co10:17|1&nbsp;Cor. 10:17}). Hence, it is also the life-propagating, life-multiplying death, the generating and reproducing death.","The Lord&rsquo;s pierced side was prefigured by Adam&rsquo;s opened side, out from which Eve was produced ({Gen2:21|Gen. 2:21}-{Gen2:23|23}). The blood was typified by the blood of the passover lamb ({Exo12:7|Exo. 12:7}, {Exo12:22|22}; {Rev12:11|Rev. 12:11}), and the water was typified by the water that flowed out of the smitten rock ({Exo17:6|Exo. 17:6}; {1Co10:4|1&nbsp;Cor. 10:4}). The blood formed a fountain for the washing away of sin ({Zec13:1|Zech. 13:1}), and the water became the fountain of life ({Psa36:9|Psa. 36:9}; {Rev21:6|Rev. 21:6})."]},

Hence, the Lord&rsquo;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. This fulfillment differs from the one in {Act2:1|Acts 2:1}-{Act2:4|4}, which was the fulfillment of the Father&rsquo;s promise in {Luk24:49|Luke 24:49}. (See {Joh14:17^1|note 17<sup>1</sup>} in {Joh14|ch. 14}.) In {Act2|Acts 2} the Spirit as a rushing, violent wind came as power upon the disciples for their work ({Act1:8|Acts 1:8}). Here the Spirit as breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord imparted Himself into them as life and everything. Thus, all that He had spoken in chs. {Joh14|14}&mdash;{Joh16|16} could be fulfilled.","As falling into the ground to die and growing out of the ground transform the grain of wheat into another form, one that is new and living, so the death and resurrection of the Lord transfigured Him from the flesh into the Spirit. As the last Adam in the flesh, through the process of death and resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit ({1Co15:45|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45}). As He is the embodiment of the Father, so the Spirit is the realization, the reality, of Him. It is as the Spirit that He was breathed into the disciples. It is as the Spirit that He is received into His believers and flows out of them as rivers of living water ({Joh7:38|7:38}-{Joh7:39|39}). It is as the Spirit that through His death and resurrection He came back to the disciples, entered into them as their Comforter, and began to abide in them ({Joh14:16|14:16}-{Joh14:17|17}). It is as the Spirit that He can live in the disciples and enable them to live by and with Him ({Joh14:19|14:19}). It is as the Spirit that He can abide in the disciples and enable them to abide in Him ({Joh14:20|14:20}; {Joh15:4|15:4}-{Joh15:5|5}). It is as the Spirit that He can come with the Father to His lover and make an abode with him ({Joh14:23|14:23}). It is as the Spirit that He can cause all that He is and has to be fully realized by the disciples ({Joh16:13|16:13}-{Joh16:16|16}). It is as the Spirit that He came to meet with His brothers as the church to declare the Father&rsquo;s name to them and to praise the Father in their midst ({Heb2:11|Heb. 2:11}-{Heb2:12|12}). It is as the Spirit that He can send His disciples for His commission, with Himself as life and everything to them, in the same way that the Father sent Him ({Joh20:21|v. 21}). They are thus qualified to represent Him with His authority in the fellowship of His Body ({Joh20:23|v. 23}) for the carrying out of His commission.","The Lord was the Word, and the Word is the eternal God ({Joh1:1|1:1}). For the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, He took two steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh ({Joh1:14|1:14}), to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man ({Joh1:29|1:29}), to declare God to man ({Joh1:18|1:18}), and to manifest the Father to His believers ({Joh14:9|14:9}-{Joh14:11|11}). Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything, and that He might bring forth many sons of God, His many brothers, for the building of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity. Hence, originally He was the eternal Word; then, through His incarnation He became flesh to accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption, and through His death and resurrection He became the Spirit to be everything and do everything for the completion of God&rsquo;s building.","This Gospel testifies that the Lord is (1) God ({Joh1:1|1:1}-{Joh1:2|2}; {Joh5:17|5:17}-{Joh5:18|18}; {Joh10:30|10:30}-{Joh10:33|33}; {Joh14:9|14:9}-{Joh14:11|11}; {Joh20:28|20:28}), (2) the life ({Joh1:4|1:4}; {Joh10:10|10:10}; {Joh11:25|11:25}; {Joh14:6|14:6}), and (3) the resurrection ({Joh11:25|11:25}). Chapters {Joh1|1}&mdash;{Joh17|17} prove that He is God among men. Men are in contrast to Him as God. Chapters {Joh18|18}&mdash;{Joh19|19} prove that He is life in the environment of death. Death, or the environment of death, is in contrast to Him as life. Chapters {Joh20|20}&mdash;{Joh21|21} prove that He is the resurrection in the midst of the old creation, the natural life. The old creation, the natural life, is in contrast to Him as the resurrection, of which the Spirit is the reality. As the resurrection, He can be realized only in the Spirit. Hence, eventually He is the Spirit in resurrection. He is God among men (chs. {Joh1|1}&mdash;{Joh17|17}), He is life in death (chs. {Joh18|18}&mdash;{Joh19|19}), and He is the Spirit in resurrection (chs. {Joh20|20}&mdash;{Joh21|21})."]},

The record in the Gospel of John is crucial regarding this matter. It shows us that the completing of Christ, who was anointed and commissioned by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal will, was carried out by the Triune God becoming flesh in order to be united with man. First, through His death in the flesh He accomplished redemption for man, and then through resurrection He was transfigured to become the Spirit that He might enter into the believers ({Joh20:22|20:22}) to be united with them, that they might be united with the Triune God ({Joh17:21|17:21}). Thus He became Christ, the embodiment of God, and is able to take away men&rsquo;s sins and enter into men to be their life that they may become the sons of God to be His members, constituting His Body as the full expression of the Triune God. Thus, He is in them to be all their reality and to be with them invisibly until their bodies are redeemed and transfigured that they may enter into His visible presence to be completely united with Him and completely like Him, and to become the New Jerusalem, which is about to be completed, as the mutual habitation of the Triune God and His redeemed people for eternity!"]},
