verses: {
'1:1': '[1]Inasmuch as [2]many have undertaken to [3]draw up a narrative concerning the [4]matters which have been fully accomplished among us,',
'1:2': 'Even as [1]those who from the beginning became [a]eyewitnesses and [2]ministers of the [3]word have [4]delivered <I>them</I> to us,',
'1:3': 'It seemed good to [1]me also, having carefully investigated all things from the first, to write <I>them</I> out for you in an [a]orderly fashion, most [b]excellent [2c]Theophilus,',
'1:4': 'So that you may fully know the certainty of the things concerning which you were instructed.',
'1:5': 'In the days of [a]Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest named Zachariah, of the [1]course of Abijah; and his wife was of the daughters of [b]Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.',
'1:6': 'And [1]they were both [2a]righteous before God, [3b]walking in all the commandments and [4]ordinances of the Lord, [c]blameless.',
'1:7': 'And they had [1]no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in their days.',
'1:8': 'And while he served as priest in the [a]order of his course before God,',
'1:9': 'According to the custom of the priestly service, the lot fell to him to enter into the [a]temple of the Lord and [1]burn incense.',
'1:10': 'And all the multitude of the people were [1a]praying outside at the hour of the burning of incense.',
'1:11': 'And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the [a]altar of incense.',
'1:12': 'And Zachariah was troubled when he saw <I>him</I>, and [a]fear fell upon him.',
'1:13': 'But the angel said to him, Do [a]not be afraid, Zachariah, because your petition has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will [1]bear you a son, and you shall call his name [2b]John.',
'1:14': 'And you will have joy and exultation, and many will rejoice at his birth.',
'1:15': 'For he will be [a]great in the sight of the Lord, and he shall by [1b]no means drink wine and liquor. And he will be filled with the [2c]Holy Spirit, even from his mother&rsquo;s [d]womb,',
'1:16': 'And many of the sons of Israel he will turn to the Lord their God.',
'1:17': 'And <I>it</I> <I>is</I> he <I>who</I> will go [a]before Him in the spirit and power of [1]Elijah to turn the [b]hearts of the fathers to the children, and the [c]disobedient [2]to the [3]prudence of the righteous, to [d]prepare for the Lord a people made ready.',
'1:18': 'And Zachariah said to the angel, By what shall I know this? For I am an [a]old man and my wife is advanced in [1]years.',
'1:19': 'And the [a]angel answered and said to him, I am [b]Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce the good news of these things to you.',
'1:20': 'And behold, you shall be [a]silent and not able to speak until the day that these things happen, because you did [1]not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.',
'1:21': 'And the people were waiting for Zachariah, and they marveled at his delaying in the [a]temple.',
'1:22': 'And when he came out, he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a [a]vision in the temple. And he made signs to them and remained dumb.',
'1:23': 'And when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went to his house.',
'1:24': 'And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived and stayed in seclusion for five months, saying,',
'1:25': 'In this way has the Lord dealt with me in the days in which He looked upon <I>me</I> to take away my [a]reproach among men.',
'1:26': 'And in the sixth month the angel [a]Gabriel was sent from God to a city of [1]Galilee named [b]Nazareth,',
'1:27': 'To a [a]virgin engaged to a man named [b]Joseph, of the house of [1c]David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary.',
'1:28': 'And he came to her and said, Rejoice, you who have been graced! The Lord is [a]with you. [1]',
'1:29': 'And she was greatly troubled at this saying and began reasoning what kind of greeting this might be.',
'1:30': 'And the angel said to her, Do [a]not be afraid, Mary, for you have found [b]grace with God.',
'1:31': 'And behold, you will [a]conceive in <I>your</I> womb and bear a son, and you shall call His name [1b]Jesus.',
'1:32': 'He will be [a]great and will be called [b]Son of the [1c]Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the [d]throne of [2e]David His father,',
'1:33': 'And He will [1]reign over the house of Jacob [a]forever, and of His [2]kingdom there will be [b]no end.',
'1:34': 'But Mary said to the angel, How will this be, since I have not known a man?',
'1:35': 'And the angel answered and said to her, The [1]Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the [a]Most High will [2]overshadow you; therefore also the [3b]holy thing which is born will be called the [c]Son of God.',
'1:36': 'And behold, Elizabeth your relative, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who is called barren,',
'1:37': 'Because no word will be [1a]impossible [2]with God.',
'1:38': 'And Mary said, Behold, the slave of the Lord. May it happen to me according to your word. And the [a]angel departed from her.',
'1:39': 'And Mary rose up in those days and went to the [a]hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,',
'1:40': 'And entered into the house of Zachariah and greeted Elizabeth.',
'1:41': 'And when Elizabeth heard Mary&rsquo;s greeting, the [1]baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the [a]Holy Spirit.',
'1:42': 'And she lifted up her voice with a loud cry and said, [1a]Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the [2b]fruit of your womb!',
'1:43': 'And how has this <I>happened</I> to me, that the mother of my [1a]Lord should come to me?',
'1:44': 'For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby leaped with exultation in my womb.',
'1:45': '[1]And blessed is she who has [2a]believed, because there will be a [3]completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord.',
'1:46': 'And Mary said, [1]My [a]soul [2b]magnifies the Lord,',
'1:47': 'And my [a]spirit [1]has [b]exulted in God my [c]Savior;',
'1:48': 'Because He has [a]looked upon the low estate of His slave. For behold, from now on all generations will count me [b]blessed,',
'1:49': 'Because the [1a]Mighty One has done [b]great things for me, and [c]holy is His name.',
'1:50': 'And His [1a]mercy is unto [b]generations and generations, unto those who [c]fear Him.',
'1:51': 'He has exercised might with His [a]arm; He has scattered <I>those</I> <I>who</I> <I>are</I> [b]proud in the understanding of their heart.',
'1:52': 'He has brought down [a]potentates from thrones and has [b]exalted the [c]humble;',
'1:53': 'The [a]hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.',
'1:54': 'He has upheld Israel His [a]servant to [b]remember mercy,',
'1:55': 'Even [1]as He spoke to our fathers, to [a]Abraham and to his seed forever.',
'1:56': 'And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home.',
'1:57': 'Now the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.',
'1:58': 'And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had magnified His mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.',
'1:59': 'And on the eighth day they came to [a]circumcise the little child, and they tried to call him after the name of his father, Zachariah.',
'1:60': 'Yet his mother answered and said, No, but he shall be called [a]John.',
'1:61': 'And they said to her, There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name.',
'1:62': 'And they gestured to his father as to what he would want him to be called.',
'1:63': 'And asking for a tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all marveled.',
'1:64': 'And his [1]mouth was opened instantly, and his [a]tongue <I>loosed</I>, and he began to speak, blessing God.',
'1:65': 'And [a]fear came on all those dwelling around them, and in all the [b]hill country of Judea all these [1]things were spread about.',
'1:66': 'And all who heard <I>these</I> <I>things</I> put <I>them</I> in their [a]heart, saying, What then will this little child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was [b]with him.',
'1:67': 'And Zachariah his father was filled with the [a]Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,',
'1:68': '[a]Blessed be the Lord, the God of [b]Israel, because He has [c]visited and accomplished [1d]redemption for His people,',
'1:69': 'And raised a [1a]horn of salvation for us in the house of [b]David His servant,',
'1:70': 'Even [1]as He spoke through the mouth of His holy [a]prophets [2]from of old&mdash;',
'1:71': '[a]Salvation from our enemies and from the [b]hand of all who hate us,',
'1:72': 'To accomplish [1]mercy with our fathers and to [2a]remember His holy [b]covenant,',
'1:73': 'The [1a]oath which He swore to Abraham our father,',
'1:74': 'To grant us that we, having been delivered out of the hand of <I>our</I> enemies, might [1]serve Him without fear,',
'1:75': 'In [1a]holiness and [b]righteousness before Him all our days.',
'1:76': 'And you also, little child, shall be called a [a]prophet of the [b]Most High, for you will go [c]before the [1]Lord to [2d]prepare His ways,',
'1:77': 'To give knowledge of [a]salvation to His people by the [b]forgiveness of their sins,',
'1:78': 'Because of the merciful [a]compassions of our God, in which the rising [1b]sun will [c]visit us from on high,',
'1:79': 'To shine upon those sitting in [a]darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of [b]peace.',
'1:80': 'And the little child [a]grew and became strong in [1]spirit, and he was in the [b]wilderness until the day of his presentation to Israel.',
'2:1': 'And in those days a decree went out from [a]Caesar Augustus for a [b]census to be taken of all the inhabited earth.',
'2:2': 'This was the [1]first census that took place when Quirinius [a]governed Syria.',
'2:3': 'And all went to be registered, each to his own city.',
'2:4': 'And [a]Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of [b]Nazareth into Judea, to David&rsquo;s city, which is called [c]Bethlehem, because he was of the [1]house and family of David,',
'2:5': 'To be registered with Mary, who was engaged to him and was [a]pregnant.',
'2:6': 'And while they were there, the days were fulfilled for her to bear,',
'2:7': 'And she [1a]bore her [b]firstborn son; and she wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a [2]manger because there was no place for them in the [c]inn.',
'2:8': 'And there were [1]shepherds in the same region, spending their nights in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.',
'2:9': 'And an [a]angel of the Lord [b]stood by them, and the [c]glory of the Lord shone around them; and they [d]feared greatly.',
'2:10': 'And the angel said to them, Do [a]not be afraid; for behold, I [b]announce to you good news of [c]great joy, which will be for [d]all the people,',
'2:11': 'Because today a [a]Savior has been [b]born to you in [c]David&rsquo;s city, who is [d]Christ the [e]Lord.',
'2:12': 'And this will be the [1]sign to you: you will find a [2]baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.',
'2:13': 'And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly [a]army, [1b]praising God and saying,',
'2:14': '[1a]Glory in the [b]highest <I>places</I> to God, and on [c]earth [1d]peace among [2]men of <I>His</I> [e]good pleasure.',
'2:15': 'And when the angels departed from them into heaven, the shepherds spoke to one another, Let us go then to Bethlehem and see this [1]thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.',
'2:16': 'And they came in haste and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger.',
'2:17': 'And when they had seen <I>this</I>, they made known the word which was spoken to them concerning this little child.',
'2:18': 'And all those who heard marveled at the things spoken to them by the shepherds.',
'2:19': 'But Mary kept all these things and pondered <I>them</I> in her [a]heart.',
'2:20': 'And the shepherds returned, [a]glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken to them.',
'2:21': 'And when eight days were fulfilled to [a]circumcise Him, His name was called [b]Jesus, the name given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.',
'2:22': 'And when the days for their [a]purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they [b]brought Him up to Jerusalem to present <I>Him</I> to the Lord',
'2:23': '(Even as it is written in the [a]law of the Lord, [b]&ldquo;Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord&rdquo;),',
'2:24': 'And to give a sacrifice according to what is said in the [1]law of the Lord: [2]A pair of turtledoves or two young doves.',
'2:25': 'And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. And this man was [1a]righteous and [b]devout, [c]waiting for the [2d]consolation of Israel, and the [e]Holy Spirit was upon him.',
'2:26': 'And it had been divinely communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would [a]not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s [b]Christ.',
'2:27': 'And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the little child Jesus for them to do according to the custom of the [a]law concerning Him,',
'2:28': 'He received Him into his arms and [a]blessed God and said,',
'2:29': 'Now You release Your slave, Master, according to Your word, in [a]peace;',
'2:30': 'For my eyes have seen Your [1a]salvation,',
'2:31': 'Which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples,',
'2:32': 'A [1a]light for revelation to the Gentiles and the [b]glory of Your people Israel.',
'2:33': 'And His father and mother marveled at the things being spoken about Him.',
'2:34': 'And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary His mother, Behold, this One is [1]appointed for the [a]falling and rising up of many in Israel and for a [2]sign [b]spoken against&mdash;',
'2:35': 'And a [1]sword will pierce through your own soul also&mdash;so that the reasonings of many hearts may be [2]revealed.',
'2:36': 'And there was one Anna, a [a]prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of [b]Asher. She was well advanced in years, having lived with <I>her</I> husband seven years from her virginity,',
'2:37': '[1]And she was a [a]widow up to the age of eighty-four, who did not depart from the temple, [2]serving <I>God</I> with [b]fastings and petitions [c]night and day.',
'2:38': 'And at that very hour she came up and returned thanks to God, and spoke concerning Him to all those [a]waiting for the [1b]redemption [2]of Jerusalem.',
'2:39': 'And when they had finished all things according to the [a]law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city, [1b]Nazareth.',
'2:40': 'And the little child [1]grew and became strong, being filled with [2a]wisdom, and the [3]grace of God was upon Him.',
'2:41': 'And His parents went year by year to [a]Jerusalem at the Feast of the [b]Passover.',
'2:42': 'And when He became [1]twelve years old, they went up according to the [2a]custom of the feast.',
'2:43': 'And when they had completed the days, while they were returning, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know <I>it</I>.',
'2:44': 'But supposing that He was in the company, they went a day&rsquo;s journey and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances.',
'2:45': 'And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem searching for Him.',
'2:46': 'And after three days they found Him in the [a]temple, sitting in the midst of the [b]teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.',
'2:47': 'And all those who heard Him were [a]amazed at His understanding and His answers.',
'2:48': 'And when they saw Him, they were astounded; and His mother said to Him, Child, why have You treated us like this? Behold, Your father and I, being [1]greatly distressed, have been seeking You.',
'2:49': 'And He said to them, Why is it that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I [1]must be [2]in the things of [3a]My Father?',
'2:50': 'And they did [a]not understand the word which He spoke to them.',
'2:51': 'And He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was [1]subject to them. And His mother carefully kept all these things in her [a]heart.',
'2:52': 'And Jesus advanced in wisdom and [1]stature and in the [2a]grace <I>manifested</I> <I>in</I> <I>Him</I> before God and men.',
'3:1': 'Now in the fifteenth year of the government of Tiberius [a]Caesar, while [b]Pontius Pilate was [c]governor of Judea, and [d]Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,',
'3:2': 'During the high priesthood of Annas and [a]Caiaphas, the word of God came to [b]John the son of Zachariah in the [1c]wilderness.',
'3:3': 'And he came into all the region surrounding the Jordan, proclaiming a [1]baptism of [a]repentance [2]for [b]forgiveness of sins,',
'3:4': 'As it is written in the book of the words of [a]Isaiah the prophet, [1b]&ldquo;A voice of one crying in the wilderness, [c]Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.',
'3:5': 'Every [1]ravine shall be filled up, and every [a]mountain and hill shall be leveled; and the [b]crooked <I>places</I> shall become a straight <I>way</I>, and the rough ways smooth.',
'3:6': 'And all [1]flesh shall see the [2a]salvation of God.&rdquo;',
'3:7': 'He said therefore to the crowds going out to be baptized by him, [1]Offspring of [a]vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming [b]wrath?',
'3:8': 'Produce then fruits [a]worthy of your repentance, and do not begin to say within yourselves, We have [b]Abraham as <I>our</I> father; for I tell you that God is able out of these stones to [1]raise up children to Abraham.',
'3:9': 'And already also the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not produce [a]good fruit is cut down and cast into the [1]fire.',
'3:10': 'And the crowds asked him, saying, [a]What then shall we do?',
'3:11': 'And he answered and said to them, He who has two [1a]tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise.',
'3:12': 'And [a]tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, Teacher, what shall we do?',
'3:13': 'And he said to them, [a]Exact nothing more than what you have been ordered to.',
'3:14': 'And some serving in the military also questioned him, saying, And we, what shall we do? And he said to them, Extort nothing from anyone by force, nor [1]take <I>anything</I> by false accusation, and be content with your wages.',
'3:15': 'Now while the people were in [1]expectation and all were reasoning in their hearts concerning John, whether he might possibly be the Christ,',
'3:16': 'John answered and said to all, I [1]baptize you in [a]water, but He who is stronger than I is coming, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He Himself will baptize you in the [b]Holy Spirit and fire,',
'3:17': 'Whose winnowing fan is in His hand to thoroughly cleanse His [a]threshing floor and to gather the wheat into His [b]barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable [1c]fire.',
'3:18': 'So, exhorting <I>them</I> with many other things also, he [1a]announced the gospel to the people.',
'3:19': 'But Herod the tetrarch, because he was reproved by him concerning [a]Herodias, his brother&rsquo;s wife, and concerning all the evil things which Herod did,',
'3:20': 'Added this also above all: he shut John up in [a]prison.',
'3:21': 'Now when all the people were baptized and as Jesus was [1a]baptized and was praying, heaven was opened,',
'3:22': 'And the [1a]Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him. And a voice came out of heaven: You are My Son, the [b]Beloved; in You I have found My delight.',
'3:23': 'And He, Jesus, when He [a]began <I>to</I> <I>minister</I>, was about [1]thirty years old, being, [2]so it was thought, the [3]son of [4b]Joseph, the <I>son</I> of Heli,',

'4:15': 'And He [1a]taught in their [2b]synagogues and was [3]glorified by all.',
'4:16': 'And He [a]came to [b]Nazareth, where He had been brought up, and according to His [c]custom He entered on the [d]Sabbath day into the [e]synagogue and stood up to [f]read.',
'4:17': 'And the scroll of the prophet [a]Isaiah was handed to Him. And He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written,',
'4:18': '[a]&ldquo;The [1b]Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has [c]anointed Me to [2d]announce the gospel to the [3e]poor; He has sent Me to proclaim [f]release to the [4]captives, and [5]recovery of sight to the [6g]blind, to send away in release those who are [7h]oppressed,',

'4:22': 'And all bore witness to Him and [a]marveled at the [1]words of [b]grace proceeding out of His mouth, and they said, Is not this [2c]Joseph&rsquo;s son?',
'4:23': 'And He said to them, Surely you will say this proverb to Me, Physician, heal [a]yourself! What we heard happening in [b]Capernaum, do here also in Your <I>own</I> country.',
'4:24': 'And He said, Truly I say to you that no prophet is acceptable in his <I>own</I> country.',
'4:25': 'But in truth I say to you, There were many widows in Israel in the days of [a]Elijah, when the sky was shut up for three years and six months, when a great famine came over all the land;',
'4:26': 'And to none of them was Elijah sent, except to <I>the</I> <I>city</I> <I>of</I> [1a]Sarepta of [b]Sidon, to a [2]woman <I>who</I> <I>was</I> a widow.',
'4:27': 'And there were many [a]lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them were cleansed, except [b]Naaman the Syrian.',
'4:28': 'And all in the synagogue were filled with [a]anger when they heard these things,',
'4:29': 'And they rose up and [a]cast Him out of the city and led Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built so that they might throw Him down the cliff.',
'4:30': 'But He, [1]passing through their midst, [a]went away.',
'4:31': 'And He [a]came down to [b]Capernaum, a city of Galilee. And He [c]taught them on the [d]Sabbath.',

'4:37': 'And [1a]reports went out concerning Him into every place of the surrounding region.',
'4:38': 'And He rose up <I>and</I> <I>went</I> from the synagogue and [a]entered into the house of Simon. And [1]Simon&rsquo;s mother-in-law was [2]suffering with a high [3]fever, and they asked Him concerning her.',
'4:39': 'And standing over her, He [a]rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she instantly rose up and served them.',
'4:40': 'And when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He [a]laid His hands on each one of them and healed them.',
'4:41': 'And demons also came out from many, [a]crying out and saying, You are the [b]Son of God! And He rebuked <I>them</I> and would [c]not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the [d]Christ.',
'4:42': 'And when [a]day came, He departed and went into a [b]deserted place. And the crowds [c]sought Him, and they came up to Him and tried to hold on to Him so that He would not go away from them.',

'4:44': 'And He [1]preached in the [a]synagogues of [2]Judea.',
'5:1': 'And as the crowd pressed upon Him to hear the word of God, He was [a]standing by the [1]lake of [b]Gennesaret.',
'5:2': 'And He [1]saw two boats lying by the lake, and the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing the nets.',
'5:3': 'And He got into one of the [a]boats, which was [1]Simon&rsquo;s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and from the boat taught the crowds.',
'5:4': 'And when He ceased speaking, He said to Simon, Put out into the deep and let down your [a]nets for a catch.',
'5:5': 'And Simon answered and said, [1]Master, through the whole night we toiled and caught [a]nothing; but based on Your word I will let down the nets.',
'5:6': 'And when they did this, they enclosed a great number of [a]fish, and their nets began to tear apart.',
'5:7': 'And they signaled to their companions in the other boat to come and assist them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.',
'5:8': 'And when Simon Peter saw <I>this</I>, he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a [a]sinful man, Lord.',

'5:10': 'And likewise also James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were [1]partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Do not be afraid. From now on you will be [2a]catching men alive.',
'5:11': 'And when they had brought the boats to the land, they [a]left all and [b]followed Him.',
'5:12': 'And while He was in one of the cities, behold, there was a [1a]man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, he [b]fell on <I>his</I> face and begged Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me.',
'5:13': 'And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed! And immediately the leprosy left him.',
'5:14': 'And He charged him to tell [a]no one: But go away, show yourself to the [b]priest, and offer <I>the</I> <I>gift</I> for your cleansing, even as [c]Moses directed, for a [d]testimony to them.',
'5:15': 'But the word concerning Him spread abroad all the more, and [a]great crowds came together to hear <I>Him</I> and to be [b]healed from their infirmities.',
'5:16': 'But He Himself <I>often</I> withdrew in the [a]wilderness and [1b]prayed.',
'5:17': 'And on one of the days He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and [a]teachers of the law sitting <I>there</I>, who had come out of every [b]village of Galilee and [c]Judea and Jerusalem. And the [d]power of the Lord [1]was with Him to heal.',
'5:18': 'And behold, some men [a]brought on a bed a [1b]man who was paralyzed, and they sought <I>a</I> <I>way</I> to carry him in and lay him before Him.',
'5:19': 'And since they could not find by what <I>way</I> they might carry him in because of the crowd, they went up onto the housetop and let him down with the cot through the tiles into the midst, in front of Jesus.',
'5:20': 'And seeing their [a]faith, He said, Man, your sins are [b]forgiven you.',
'5:21': 'And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks [a]blasphemies? Who can [b]forgive sins except God alone?',
'5:22': 'But Jesus, [a]knowing fully their reasonings, answered and said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts?',
'5:23': 'Which is easier: to say, Your sins are forgiven you, or to say, Rise and walk?',
'5:24': 'But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to [a]forgive sins&mdash;He said to the one paralyzed, To you I say, Rise and take up your cot and go to your house.',
'5:25': 'And he rose up at once before them and took up that upon which he was lying and went away to his house, [a]glorifying God.',
'5:26': 'And astonishment took hold of all, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen extraordinary things today.',
'5:27': 'And after these things He went out and beheld a [1a]tax collector named Levi [b]sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me.',
'5:28': 'And leaving all, he rose up and [a]followed Him.',
'5:29': 'And Levi gave a great reception for Him in his [1]house; and there was a great crowd of [a]tax collectors and others who were reclining <I>at</I> <I>table</I> with them.',
'5:30': 'And the Pharisees and their [a]scribes murmured at His disciples, saying, Why do you [b]eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?',
'5:31': 'And Jesus answered and said to them, Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill;',
'5:32': 'I have not come to call the [a]righteous, but [b]sinners to [c]repentance.',
'5:33': 'And they [a]said to Him, The [1b]disciples of John [c]fast often and make petitions, likewise also those of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink.',
'5:34': 'And Jesus said to them, You cannot make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the [a]bridegroom is with them, can you?',
'5:35': 'But the [a]days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days.',
'5:36': 'And He also spoke a parable to them: No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts <I>it</I> on an old garment; otherwise, [1]he will tear the new <I>garment</I>, and also the patch from the new will not match the old.',
'5:37': 'And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be poured out and the wineskins will be ruined;',
'5:38': 'But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.',
'5:39': 'And no one who has drunk the old desires the new, for he says, The old is better.',
'6:1': '[1]And [2]one [a]Sabbath He was going through the grainfields, and His disciples were picking and eating the [b]ears of grain, rubbing <I>them</I> in their hands.',
'6:2': 'And some of the [a]Pharisees said, Why are you doing what is [b]not lawful to do on the Sabbath?',

'6:4': 'How he entered into the house of God, and taking the [a]bread of the Presence, he ate <I>it</I> and gave <I>some</I> to those with him, which is not lawful <I>for</I> <I>anyone</I> to eat except the priests alone?',
'6:5': 'And He said to them, The [a]Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.',
'6:6': 'And [1]on another Sabbath He entered into the [a]synagogue and [2]taught. And there was a [b]man there, and his right hand was withered.',
'6:7': 'And the scribes and the Pharisees were [a]watching Him closely <I>to</I> <I>see</I> if He would heal on the Sabbath, so that they might find <I>reason</I> to [b]accuse Him.',
'6:8': 'But He [a]knew their reasonings and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise and stand in the midst. And he rose up and stood.',
'6:9': 'And Jesus said to them, I ask you, Is it [a]lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a [1]life or to destroy <I>it</I>?',
'6:10': 'And [a]looking around at all of them, He said to him, Stretch out your hand. And he did, and his hand was restored.',
'6:11': 'But they were filled with [1a]rage and [b]discussed with one another what they might do to Jesus.',
'6:12': 'And in these days He went out to the mountain to [1a]pray, and He spent the whole night in [2]prayer to God.',
'6:13': 'And when it became day, He [1a]called His [b]disciples to <I>Him</I>, and He chose from them twelve, whom He also named [c]apostles:',
'6:14': '[a]Simon, whom He also named [b]Peter, and [c]Andrew his brother and [d]James and John and [e]Philip and Bartholomew',
'6:15': 'And [a]Matthew and Thomas and James <I>the</I> <I>son</I> of Alphaeus and Simon, who was called Zealot,',
'6:16': 'And [a]Judas <I>the</I> [1]<I>brother</I> of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became the traitor.',
'6:17': 'And He came down with them and stood on a level place; and there was a [a]great crowd of His disciples, and a great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast of [b]Tyre and Sidon, who had come to hear Him and to be healed of their diseases.',
'6:18': 'And those who were troubled by unclean [a]spirits were healed.',
'6:19': 'And all the crowd sought to [a]touch Him, because [b]power was going out from Him and healing all.',
'6:20': 'And He [a]lifted up His eyes to His disciples and [b]said, [1]Blessed are the [2c]poor, for yours is the [3d]kingdom of God.',
'6:21': 'Blessed are those who [a]hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are those who [b]weep now, for you shall laugh.',
'6:22': 'Blessed are you when men [a]hate you and when they separate you from <I>them</I> and [b]reproach <I>you</I> and [c]cast out your name as evil, for the Son of Man&rsquo;s sake.',
'6:23': '[a]Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the [b]prophets.',
'6:24': '[1]But [a]woe to you who are [b]rich, for you have [2c]received your consolation in full.',

'6:28': '[a]Bless those who curse you; [b]pray for those who revile you.',

'6:31': 'And just as you want men to [a]do to you, do to them likewise.',
'6:32': 'And if you [a]love those who love you, what [1]thanks is it to you? For even sinners love those who love them.',
'6:33': 'For if you also do good to those who do good to you, what thanks is it to you? Even sinners do the same.',

'6:35': 'But love your [a]enemies, and do good and [b]lend, [1]expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be [c]sons of the [d]Most High; for He is kind to the unthankful and evil.',

'6:39': 'And He also spoke a parable to them: [1]A [2]blind man cannot [a]guide a blind man, can he? Will not both fall into a pit?',
'6:40': 'A [a]disciple is not above the teacher, but everyone who has been perfected will be like his teacher.',
'6:41': 'And why do you [1]look at the [a]splinter which is in your brother&rsquo;s eye, but the beam which is in your [b]own eye you do not consider?',
'6:42': 'How can you say to your brother, Brother, let me remove the splinter which is in your eye, you yourself not seeing the beam which is in your eye? [1]Hypocrite, first remove the beam from your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the splinter which is in your brother&rsquo;s eye.',
'6:43': 'For there is [a]no good tree that produces corrupt fruit, nor again a corrupt tree that produces good fruit.',
'6:44': 'For each tree is [a]known by its own fruit. For <I>men</I> do not collect figs from thorns, nor do they pick grapes from a thornbush.',
'6:45': 'The good man, out of the [a]good treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is good, and the evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, brings forth that which is evil; for [b]out of the abundance of <I>his</I> heart his mouth speaks.',
'6:46': 'And why do you call Me, [a]Lord, Lord, and do not do the things that I say?',
'6:47': '[1]Everyone who comes to Me and [a]hears My words and does them, I will show you whom he is like.',
'6:48': 'He is like a man building a house, who dug and went deep and laid a foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the river broke out against that house, yet it was not strong enough to shake it, because it had been built well.',
'6:49': 'But he who hears and does not do is like a man who built a house upon the earth without a foundation, against which the river broke out, and immediately it [a]collapsed, and the crash of that house was great.',
'7:1': 'After He completed all His words in the [1]hearing of the people, He [2a]entered into [b]Capernaum.',
'7:2': 'And a certain [a]centurion&rsquo;s slave, who was highly valued by him, was ill and about to die.',
'7:3': 'And when he heard about Jesus, he sent to Him some elders of the Jews, requesting that He would come and [1]completely heal his slave.',
'7:4': 'And when they came to Jesus, they entreated Him earnestly, saying, He is worthy of Your granting this <I>to</I> <I>him</I>,',
'7:5': 'For he loves our nation, and he himself built the [a]synagogue for us.',
'7:6': 'And Jesus went with them. But already, when He was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to Him, Lord, do [a]not trouble Yourself, for I am not fit for You to enter under my roof;',
'7:7': 'Therefore, I did not count even myself worthy to come to You. But speak a [a]word, and let my servant be healed.',
'7:8': 'For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does <I>it</I>.',
'7:9': 'And when Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found such great [a]faith.',
'7:10': 'And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the slave in good health.',
'7:11': 'And [1]soon afterward He went into a city called Nain, and His disciples went with Him, as well as a large crowd.',
'7:12': 'And as He came near the gate of the city, behold, one who had died was being carried out, an [a]only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and a considerable crowd from the city was with her.',
'7:13': 'And when the Lord saw her, He was [1]moved with [a]compassion for her and said to her, Do [b]not weep.',
'7:14': 'And He came near and touched the bier, and those carrying <I>it</I> stood still. And He said, Young man, to you I say, [a]Arise.',
'7:15': 'And the [a]dead man sat up and began to speak. And He [b]gave him to his mother.',
'7:16': 'And [a]fear took hold of all, and they [b]glorified God, saying, A great [c]prophet has been raised up among us, and, God has [d]visited His people!',
'7:17': 'And this report concerning Him went out in the whole of [1]Judea and in all the surrounding region.',
'7:18': 'And [1]John&rsquo;s [a]disciples [b]reported to him concerning all these things.',

'7:20': 'And the men came to Him and said, John the Baptist sent us to You, saying, Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?',
'7:21': 'In that hour He [a]healed many from diseases and afflictions and evil spirits, and to many who were [b]blind He graciously gave sight.',
'7:22': 'And He answered and said to them, Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: the [a]blind receive their sight, the [b]lame walk, the [c]lepers are cleansed and the [d]deaf hear, the [e]dead are raised, the [f]poor have the gospel [1]announced to them.',
'7:23': 'And [1]blessed is he who is not [a]stumbled because of Me.',
'7:24': 'And when the messengers of John went away, He began to say to the crowds concerning John, What did you go out into the [a]wilderness to look at? A reed shaken by the wind?',
'7:25': 'But what did you go out to see? A man arrayed in soft garments? Behold, those who live in splendid apparel and luxury are in royal palaces.',
'7:26': 'But what did you go out to see? A [a]prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.',
'7:27': 'This is he concerning whom it is written, [a]&ldquo;Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.&rdquo;',
'7:28': 'I say to you, Among those born of women there is no one greater than John, yet he who is least in the [a]kingdom of God is greater than he.',
'7:29': 'And when all the people and the tax collectors heard <I>this</I>, they [a]acknowledged that God was righteous, since they had been [b]baptized with the [c]baptism of John.',
'7:30': 'But the [a]Pharisees and the [1b]lawyers [2]rejected the [c]counsel of God for themselves since they had not been baptized by him.',

'7:38': 'And she stood behind <I>Him</I> at His feet weeping and began to wet His feet with her tears and wiped <I>them</I> with the [1a]hair of her head, and she kissed His feet [2]affectionately and anointed <I>them</I> with the [3]ointment.',

'7:43': 'Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he graciously forgave the more. And He said to him, You have judged correctly.',
'7:44': 'And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you did not [1]give Me water for My [a]feet, but she, with her tears, has wet My feet and with her hair has wiped <I>them</I>.',
'7:45': 'You did not give Me a [a]kiss, but she, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing My feet affectionately.',
'7:46': 'You did not anoint My head with [a]oil, but she has anointed My feet with ointment.',

'8:7': 'And other <I>seed</I> fell in the midst of the [a]thorns, and the thorns grew with <I>it</I> and choked it off.',
'8:8': 'And other <I>seed</I> fell into the good earth, and when it grew, it produced fruit a [a]hundredfold. When He had said these things, He called out, He who has ears to hear, let him [b]hear.',
'8:9': 'And His disciples questioned Him as to what this parable might be.',
'8:10': 'And He said, To you it has been given to know the [a]mysteries of the [1]kingdom of God, but to the rest <I>they</I> <I>are</I> in parables, in order that [b]seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.',
'8:11': 'Now the [a]parable is this: The seed is the [b]word of God.',
'8:12': 'And those beside the way are those who heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they would not believe and be [a]saved.',
'8:13': 'And those on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with [a]joy; yet these have no root, who believe <I>only</I> for a while, and in time of [b]trial they draw back.',
'8:14': 'And that which fell into the thorns, these are those who heard and, going away, are utterly choked by [a]anxieties and [b]riches and [c]pleasures of this [1]life, and do not bring <I>any</I> <I>fruit</I> to maturity.',
'8:15': 'But that which is in the good earth, these are those who in a [a]noble and good heart hear the word and hold <I>it</I> fast and [b]bear fruit with [c]endurance.',
'8:16': 'Now [a]no one who has lit a [1b]lamp covers it with a vessel or puts <I>it</I> underneath a bed, but he puts <I>it</I> on a lampstand in order that those who come in may see the light.',
'8:17': 'For nothing is [a]hidden which shall not become manifest, nor concealed which shall not by all means be made known and come into the open.',
'8:18': '[a]Take heed therefore how you [b]hear, for whoever [c]has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.',
'8:19': 'And His [1]mother and [a]brothers [b]came up to Him and were not able to get to Him because of the crowd.',
'8:20': 'And it was reported to Him, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside wanting to see You.',
'8:21': 'But He answered and said to them, My mother and My brothers are these who [a]hear the word of God and do <I>it</I>.',
'8:22': 'And on one of the days He and His disciples [1]got into a [a]boat. And He said to them, Let us go over to the [b]other side of the [c]lake. And they launched out.',
'8:23': 'And while they were sailing, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down upon the lake, and they began to fill with <I>water</I> and were in danger.',
'8:24': 'And they came to <I>Him</I> and woke Him, saying, [1]Master, Master, we are perishing! And being awakened, He [a]rebuked the wind and the surging of the water, and they [b]ceased, and there was a [c]calm.',
'8:25': 'And He said to them, Where is your faith? And they [a]became frightened and marveled, saying to one another, Who then is this, that He orders even the winds and the water, and they obey Him?',
'8:26': 'And they [1]sailed down to the region of the [a]Gerasenes, which is across from Galilee.',
'8:27': 'And when He went out onto the land, a certain man out of the city, who had demons, met <I>Him</I>, and for a considerable time he had not put on clothes and did not remain in a house but among the tombs.',
'8:28': 'And when he saw Jesus, he [a]cried out and fell before Him and said in a loud voice, What do I have to do with You, Jesus, Son of the [b]Most High God? I beseech You, do not torment me.',
'8:29': 'For He had charged the [a]unclean spirit to come out from the man; for many times it had seized him and he had been bound with chains and shackles and was kept under watch, yet <I>every</I> <I>time</I> he tore the bonds apart and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.',
'8:30': 'And Jesus questioned him, What is your name? And he said, Legion, because many demons had entered into him.',
'8:31': 'And they entreated Him not to order them to depart into the [a]abyss.',
'8:32': 'Now there was a herd of many [a]hogs feeding there on the mountain. And they entreated Him to permit them to enter into them, and He gave them permission.',
'8:33': 'And the demons came out from the man and entered into the hogs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the [a]lake and was drowned.',
'8:34': 'And when those who were feeding <I>them</I> saw what had happened, they fled and reported <I>it</I> in the city and in the countryside.',
'8:35': 'And <I>the</I> <I>people</I> went out to see what had happened. And they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had come out, [a]sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and sane, and they became frightened.',
'8:36': 'And those who had seen <I>it</I> reported to them how the demon-possessed man had been [1]healed.',
'8:37': 'And all the multitude from the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked Him to [a]depart from them, for they were seized with great [b]fear; and He got into a boat and returned.',
'8:38': 'And the man from whom the demons had come out begged to be with Him, but He sent him away, saying,',
'8:39': 'Return to your house, and relate what great things God has done for you. And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done for him.',
'8:40': 'Now as Jesus was [1a]returning, the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.',
'8:41': 'And behold, a [1]man came whose name was Jairus, and this man was a [a]ruler of the synagogue. And he fell at Jesus&rsquo; feet and entreated Him to enter into his house,',
'8:42': 'Because he had an [a]only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. And as He went, the crowds [1]pressed against Him.',
'8:43': 'And a woman who had a [a]flow of blood for twelve years <I>and</I> who [1]had spent all her livelihood on physicians and yet could not be healed by anyone,',
'8:44': 'Approached <I>Him</I> from behind and touched the [a]fringe of His garment, and instantly her flow of blood stopped.',
'8:45': 'And Jesus said, Who is the one who touched Me? And when all denied <I>it</I>, Peter[1] said, Master, the crowds are pressing and crushing You.',
'8:46': 'But Jesus said, Someone touched Me, for I perceived that [a]power had gone out from Me.',
'8:47': 'And when the woman saw that she had not escaped notice, she came trembling and fell down before Him and declared before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she had been instantly healed.',
'8:48': 'And He said to her, Daughter, your [a]faith has [1]healed you. Go [2]in peace.',
'8:49': 'While He was still speaking, someone came from <I>the</I> <I>house</I> <I>of</I> the ruler of the synagogue, saying, Your daughter has died; do [a]not trouble the [b]Teacher any longer.',
'8:50': 'But Jesus, hearing it, answered him, Do not be afraid&mdash;only believe, and she will be healed.',
'8:51': 'And He came to the house and did not allow anyone to enter with Him, except [a]Peter and [1]John and James and the father of the child and the mother.',
'8:52': 'And all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, Do [a]not weep, for she has not died but is [b]sleeping.',
'8:53': 'And they laughed scornfully at Him, knowing that she had died.',
'8:54': 'But He [a]took hold of her hand and called out, saying, Child, [b]arise!',
'8:55': 'And her [a]spirit returned and she rose up instantly; and He directed that <I>something</I> be given to her to eat.',
'8:56': 'And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell [a]no one what had happened.',
'9:1': 'And He [a]called together the twelve[1] and gave them power and [2b]authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.',
'9:2': 'And He [a]sent them to proclaim the [1b]kingdom of God and to [c]heal the sick.',
'9:3': 'And He said to them, [a]Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff nor a bag [1]nor bread nor money, nor have two tunics apiece.',
'9:4': 'And into whatever house you enter, remain there and from there go out.',
'9:5': 'And as many as do not receive you, as you go out from that city, [a]shake off the dust from your feet for a [b]testimony against them.',
'9:6': 'And they went out and passed through village after village, announcing the gospel and healing everywhere.',
'9:7': 'And [a]Herod the tetrarch [b]heard of all that was happening and was utterly perplexed, because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,',
'9:8': 'And by some that [a]Elijah had appeared, and by others that a certain prophet of the ancients had risen up.',
'9:9': 'And Herod said, John I [1a]beheaded, but who is this concerning whom I hear such things? And he [b]sought to see Him.',
'9:10': 'And when the apostles returned, they [a]related to Him the things they had done. And [b]taking them aside, He withdrew privately into a city called Bethsaida.',
'9:11': 'But the [a]crowds found out and followed Him, and He welcomed them and spoke to them concerning the [b]kingdom of God; and those who had need of healing He [c]healed.',
'9:12': 'And the [1]day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to Him, [a]Send the crowd away so that they may go into the surrounding villages and [2]countryside to lodge and find provisions, because we are here in a deserted place.',
'9:13': 'But He said to them, You [a]give them <I>something</I> to eat. But they said, We have no more than [b]five loaves and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people.',
'9:14': 'For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, Make them recline in [1]groups of about fifty each.',
'9:15': 'And they did so and made <I>them</I> all recline.',
'9:16': 'And He took the five loaves and the two fish, and [a]looking up to heaven, He [b]blessed and broke them and gave <I>them</I> to the disciples to set before the crowd.',
'9:17': 'And they ate and were all satisfied. And what was left over among them was taken up, [1]twelve handbaskets of broken pieces.',
'9:18': 'And as He was praying alone, the disciples were with Him, and He [1]questioned them, saying, [a]Who do the crowds say that I am?',
'9:19': 'And they answered and said, [a]John the Baptist, and others [b]Elijah, and others that a certain prophet of the ancients has risen up.',
'9:20': 'And He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am? And Peter answered and said, The [a]Christ of God.',
'9:21': 'But He charged them and commanded <I>them</I> to tell this to [a]no one,',
'9:22': '[a]Saying, The [b]Son of Man must suffer many things, and be [1c]rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the [d]third day be raised.',
'9:23': 'And He said to <I>them</I> all, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his [a]cross [b]daily and follow Me.',
'9:24': 'For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall [1]lose it; but whoever [1]loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it.',
'9:25': 'For what is a man profited if he [1]gains the whole world but loses or [1]forfeits himself?',
'9:26': 'For whoever is [a]ashamed of Me and of My words, of this one will the Son of Man be ashamed when He [b]comes in His glory and <I>the</I> <I>glory</I> of the Father and of the [c]holy angels.',
'9:27': 'But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by [a]no means [b]taste death until they see the kingdom of God.',
'9:28': 'And about [1]eight days after these words, He [a]took with <I>Him</I> [b]Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to [c]pray.',
'9:29': 'And as He prayed, the appearance of His face became [a]different, and His garment [1]dazzling [b]white.',
'9:30': 'And behold, two men were conversing with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,',
'9:31': 'Who appeared in glory and spoke of His [a]departure, which He was about to complete in Jerusalem.',
'9:32': 'Now Peter and those with him had been overcome with [a]sleep, but when they had fully woken up, they saw His [b]glory and the two men who were standing with Him.',
'9:33': 'And as they were departing from Him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three [a]tents, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah&mdash;not knowing what he was saying.',
'9:34': 'And while he said these things, a [a]cloud appeared and overshadowed them; and they became frightened as they entered into the cloud.',
'9:35': 'And a [a]voice came out of the cloud, [1]saying, This is My Son, the [2]Chosen One. [b]Hear Him!',
'9:36': 'And when the voice [1]had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and reported to [a]no one in those days anything of what they had seen.',
'9:37': 'And on the following day, when they came down from the mountain, a great crowd met Him.',
'9:38': 'And behold, a [a]man from the crowd called out, saying, Teacher, I beg You to look upon my son, for he is my [b]only child.',
'9:39': 'And behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it [a]throws him into convulsions with foaming; and it hardly goes away from him, <I>all</I> <I>the</I> <I>time</I> crushing him.',
'9:40': 'And I begged Your disciples to [a]cast it out, and they could not.',
'9:41': 'And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and [a]perverted generation! How long shall I be [b]with you and bear with you? Bring your son here.',
'9:42': 'And just as he was coming to <I>Him</I>, the demon threw him down and greatly convulsed <I>him</I>. But Jesus [a]rebuked the [b]unclean spirit and healed the child and [c]gave him back to his father.',
'9:43': 'And all were astounded at the [a]majesty of God.<br class="split">And while all were marveling at all the things which He did, He [b]said to His disciples,',
'9:44': 'Put these words into your ears; for the [a]Son of Man is about to be [b]delivered into the hands of men.',
'9:45': 'But they did [a]not understand this saying, and it was [b]concealed from them so that they would not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him concerning this saying.',
'9:46': 'And [a]reasoning came in among them as to which of them was [b]greatest.',
'9:47': 'And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their [a]heart, took hold of a little child and stood him beside Himself,',
'9:48': 'And He said to them, Whoever [a]receives this little child [1]because of My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me; for he who is least among you all, this one is [b]great.',
'9:49': 'And [a]John answered and said, Master, we saw someone casting out demons [b]in Your name, and we [1c]forbade him because he does not follow with us.',
'9:50': 'But Jesus said to him, Do [1]not forbid <I>him</I>, for [2]he who is [a]not against you is for you.',
'9:51': 'And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be [a]taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to [1b]Jerusalem.',
'9:52': 'And He sent messengers [a]before His face. And they went and entered into a village of the [b]Samaritans to prepare for Him.',
'9:53': 'And they did not receive Him, because His [a]face was <I>set</I> to go to Jerusalem.',
'9:54': 'And seeing <I>this</I>, the disciples James and John said, Lord, do You want us to [1]command [a]fire to come down from heaven and consume them[2]?',
'9:55': 'But turning, He rebuked them [1]and said, [2]You do not know of what kind of spirit you are.',
'9:56': '[1]The Son of Man has not come to destroy men&rsquo;s [2]lives but to save <I>them</I>. And they went into another village.',
'9:57': 'And as they went along the road, [1]someone said to Him, I will [a]follow You wherever You go.',
'9:58': 'And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven <I>have</I> roosts, but the Son of Man does [1]not have <I>a</I> <I>place</I> where He may lay His head.',
'9:59': 'And He said to [1]another, Follow Me. But he said, Lord, permit me to go first and bury my father.',
'9:60': 'But He said to him, Let the [1]dead bury their own dead, but you go and [2]announce the [a]kingdom of God everywhere.',
'9:61': 'And [1]another also said, I will follow You, Lord; but first [a]permit me to say farewell to those in my house.',
'9:62': 'But Jesus said to him, No one who puts his hand on the [1]plow and looks [a]behind is fit for the [b]kingdom of God.',
'10:1': 'Now after these things, the Lord appointed [1]seventy others and [a]sent them [2]two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.',
'10:2': 'And He said to them, The [a]harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore, [1]beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers [2]into His harvest.',
'10:3': 'Go; behold, I send you as [a]lambs in the midst of wolves.',
'10:4': 'Do [1a]not carry a purse, nor a bag, nor sandals; and greet [b]no one on the way.',
'10:5': 'And into whatever house you enter, first say, [a]Peace to this house.',
'10:6': 'And if a [1]son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon [2]it; but if not, it shall [a]return upon you.',
'10:7': 'And in that house [a]remain, [b]eating and drinking the things from them, for the [c]worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.',
'10:8': 'And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is [a]set before you;',
'10:9': 'And [a]heal the sick who are in it and say to them, The [1b]kingdom of God has drawn near to you.',
'10:10': 'But into whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,',
'10:11': 'Even the [a]dust from your city which clings to our feet, we wipe off against you; yet know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near.',
'10:12': 'I say to you that it will be [1]more tolerable for [a]Sodom in that day than for that city.',
'10:13': 'Woe to you, [a]Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the [b]works of power which took place in you had taken place in [c]Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in [d]sackcloth and ashes.',
'10:14': 'Yet it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.',
'10:15': 'And you, Capernaum, who have been [a]exalted to heaven, to [1b]Hades you will be [c]brought down.',
'10:16': 'He who hears you hears Me, and he who [a]rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who [b]sent Me.',
'10:17': 'And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us [a]in Your name.',
'10:18': 'And He said to them, I was watching Satan [1]fall like lightning out of heaven.',
'10:19': 'Behold, I have given you the [1a]authority to tread upon [2b]serpents and [2]scorpions and over all the [1]power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.',
'10:20': 'However do not rejoice in this, that the [a]spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are [b]recorded in the heavens.',
'10:21': '[1]In that hour He exulted in the Holy Spirit and [a]said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the [b]wise and intelligent and have revealed them to [c]babes. Yes, Father, for thus it has been [d]well pleasing in Your sight.',
'10:22': '[a]All things have been delivered to Me by My Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is [b]except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to [c]reveal <I>Him</I>.',
'10:23': 'And turning to the disciples, He said privately, [a]Blessed are the eyes which see the things that you see.',
'10:24': 'For I tell you that many [a]prophets and kings have wanted to [b]perceive the things that you see, and have not perceived <I>them</I>, and to hear the things that you hear, and have not heard <I>them</I>.',
'10:25': 'And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and put Him to the [1]test, [a]saying, Teacher, [2]what should I do to [3]inherit eternal life?',
'10:26': 'And He said to him, What is written in the law? How do you read <I>it</I>?',
'10:27': 'And he answered and said, [a]&ldquo;You shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and [1]with your whole soul and [1]with your whole strength and [1]with your whole mind, and [b]your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;',
'10:28': 'And He said to him, You have answered correctly; [a]do this, and you shall have life.',
'10:29': 'But he, wanting to [1]justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?',
'10:30': 'Jesus, taking up <I>the</I> <I>question</I>, said, A [1]certain man was going [2]down from [3]Jerusalem to [3a]Jericho, and he fell among [4]robbers, who having both [5]stripped him and [6]beaten <I>him</I>, went away, [7]leaving <I>him</I> half dead.',
'10:31': 'And by coincidence a certain [1]priest was going down on that road; and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.',
'10:32': 'And likewise also a [1]Levite, when he came to the place and saw <I>him</I>, passed by on the opposite side.',
'10:33': 'But a certain [1a]Samaritan, who was journeying, came upon him; and when he saw him, he was moved with [b]compassion;',
'10:34': 'And he came to <I>him</I> and [1a]bound up his wounds and poured oil and wine on <I>them</I>. And placing him on his own beast, he brought him to an inn and took care of him.',
'10:35': 'And on the next day he took out two [1a]denarii and gave <I>them</I> to the innkeeper and said, Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition <I>to</I> <I>this</I>, when I return, I will repay you.',
'10:36': 'Which of these three, does it seem to you, has [1]become a neighbor to him who fell into <I>the</I> <I>hands</I> of the robbers?',
'10:37': 'And he said, [1]The one who showed mercy to him. And Jesus said to him, Go, and you do likewise.',
'10:38': 'Now as they went, He entered into a certain [1]village, and a certain woman named [2a]Martha [b]received Him into her home.',
'10:39': 'And she had a sister called [1]Mary, who also sat at the Lord&rsquo;s [a]feet and was listening to His word.',
'10:40': 'But Martha was [1a]being drawn about with much serving, and she came up to <I>Him</I> and said, Lord, does it not matter to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to do her part with me.',
'10:41': 'But the Lord answered and said to her, Martha, Martha, you are [a]anxious and troubled about many things;',
'10:42': 'But there is need of [a]one thing, for Mary has chosen the [1b]good part, which shall not be taken away from her.',
'11:1': 'And while He was in a certain place praying, when He ceased, a certain one of His disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples.',

'15:18': 'I will [1]rise up and go [a]to my father, and I will say to him, Father, [2]I have sinned against [b]heaven and [c]before you.',
'15:19': 'I am [1]no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your [2]hired servants.',
'15:20': 'And he rose up and came to his own father. But while he was still a [a]long way off, his father [1]saw him and was moved with compassion, and he [2]ran and [3b]fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.',
'15:21': 'And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.',
'15:22': '[1]But the father said to his slaves, Bring out [2]quickly [3]the [4]best [5]robe and put <I>it</I> on him, and put a [6]ring on his hand and [7]sandals on his feet.',
'15:23': 'And bring the [1a]fattened calf; [2]slaughter <I>it</I>, and let us eat and be merry,',
'15:24': 'Because this son of mine was [1]dead and [a]lives again; he was [1]lost and has been found. And they began to be merry.',
'15:25': 'Now his [1]older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing,',
'15:26': 'And calling to <I>him</I> one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be.',
'15:27': 'And he said to him, Your brother has come, and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has received him back healthy.',
'15:28': 'But he became angry and was not willing to enter. And his father came out and entreated him.',
'15:29': 'But he answered and said to his father, Behold, so many years I have been [1]slaving for you and have never [2]neglected a command of yours, and you have never given me a goat that I might be merry with my friends;',
'15:30': 'But when this son of yours came, who devoured your [1]living with [a]harlots, you slaughtered for him the fattened calf.',
'15:31': 'And he said to him, Child, you are always with me, and all that is mine is yours.',
'15:32': 'But we had to be merry and rejoice, because this brother of yours was [1]dead and has come to life, and he was lost and has been found.',
'16:1': '[1]And He said also to the disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a [2]steward, and this one was accused to him of squandering his possessions.',
'16:2': 'And he called him and said to him, What is this I hear concerning you? Render the account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward.',
'16:3': 'And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, because my master is taking the stewardship away from me? I am not strong enough to [1]dig; I am ashamed to [2]beg.',
'16:4': 'I know what I will do so that when I am removed from the stewardship they may [1]receive me into their own houses.',
'16:5': 'And when he had called to <I>him</I> each one of his master&rsquo;s debtors, he said to the first, How much do you owe my master?',
'16:6': 'And he said, A hundred [1]measures of oil. And he said to him, Take your bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.',
'16:7': 'Then to another he said, And you, how much do you owe? And he said, A hundred [1]measures of wheat. He said to him, Take your bill and write eighty.',
'16:8': 'And the master praised the [a]unrighteous steward because he had acted [1]prudently; for the [2]sons of [b]this age are more [c]prudent <I>in</I> <I>their</I> <I>dealings</I> with their own generation than the [3]sons of [d]light.',
'16:9': 'And I say to you, [1]Make friends for yourselves by means of the mammon of [2]unrighteousness, so that when it [3]fails, they may receive you into the [4a]eternal tabernacles.',
'16:10': 'He who is [a]faithful in the [1]least is faithful also in [1]much; and he who is unrighteous in the least is unrighteous also in much.',
'16:11': 'If therefore you have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you what is [1]true?',
'16:12': 'And if you have not become faithful in that which belongs to [1]another, who will give to you that which is [2]your own?',
'16:13': 'No household servant can [1]serve [a]two masters; for either he will hate the one and [2]love the other, or he will [2]hold to one and despise the other. You cannot [1]serve God and [3]mammon.',
'16:14': 'And the [a]Pharisees, being [b]lovers of money, heard all these things and [1]were [c]sneering at Him.',
'16:15': 'And He said to them, You are those who [a]justify yourselves in the [b]sight of men, but God knows your [c]hearts; for that which is exalted among men is an [1d]abomination in the sight of God.',
'16:16': 'The [1]law and the prophets were [2]until John; from that time the [3]kingdom of God is proclaimed as the [4]gospel, and everyone [5a]forces his way into it.',

'16:18': 'Everyone who [1a]divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery, and he who marries a woman who is divorced from <I>her</I> husband commits [b]adultery.',
'16:19': 'Now there was [1]a certain rich man, and he clothed himself in [a]purple and fine linen, making merry every day in splendor.',
'16:20': 'And a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores',
'16:21': 'And longing to be [a]satisfied with the things falling from the rich man&rsquo;s [b]table; moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores.',
'16:22': 'And the beggar died, and he was carried away by the [a]angels into [1]Abraham&rsquo;s [b]bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried.',
'16:23': 'And in [1a]Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in [b]torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom.',
'16:24': 'And he called out and said, [a]Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my [b]tongue, because I am in anguish in this [c]flame.',
'16:25': 'But Abraham said, Child, remember that in your lifetime you fully received your good things, and Lazarus likewise bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish.',
'16:26': 'And besides all these things, between us and you a great [1]chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may <I>any</I> cross over.',
'16:27': 'And he said, Then I ask you, Father, to send him to the house of my father&mdash;',
'16:28': 'For I have five brothers&mdash;so that he may solemnly testify to them, lest they also come to this place of torment.',
'16:29': 'But Abraham said, They have [1a]Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.',
'16:30': 'But he said, No, Father Abraham; but if someone <I>risen</I> from the dead would go to them, they will repent.',
'16:31': 'But he said to him, If they do [1]not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead.',
'17:1': 'And He said to His disciples, It is impossible for causes of [a]stumbling not to come, but [b]woe <I>to</I> <I>him</I> through [c]whom they come.',
'17:2': 'It is <I>more</I> profitable for him if a [a]millstone is put around his neck and he is hurled into the sea than to stumble one of these little ones.',
'17:3': '[a]Take heed to yourselves. If your brother [b]sins, [c]rebuke him; and if he repents, [d]forgive him.',
'17:4': 'And if he sins against you [a]seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him.',
'17:5': 'And the apostles said to the Lord, [1a]Increase our faith.',
'17:6': 'But the Lord said, If you have [a]faith like a [b]mustard seed, you would have said to this [c]sycamine tree, Be uprooted and be planted in the sea; and it would have obeyed you.',
'17:7': 'But which of you, having a slave who is plowing or tending sheep, will say to him when he has come in from the field, Come immediately and recline <I>at</I> <I>table</I>?',
'17:8': 'Will he not rather say to him, Prepare something that I may dine, and [a]gird yourself and serve me until I eat and drink; and after that you will eat and drink?',
'17:9': 'He does not thank the slave because he did the things which were ordered, does he?',
'17:10': 'So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are [a]unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done.',
'17:11': 'And as He was going to [a]Jerusalem, He passed between [b]Samaria and [c]Galilee.',
'17:12': 'And as He entered into a certain village, ten [1a]leprous men, who stood at a distance, met Him.',
'17:13': 'And they raised <I>their</I> voice, saying, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!',
'17:14': 'And when He saw <I>them</I>, He said to them, Go and show yourselves to the [a]priests. And as they [1]went, they were cleansed.',
'17:15': 'And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, returned, [a]glorifying God with a loud voice;',
'17:16': 'And he [a]fell on <I>his</I> face at His feet, thanking Him. And he was a [b]Samaritan.',
'17:17': 'And Jesus answered and said, Were not the ten cleansed? But the nine, where <I>are</I> <I>they</I>?',
'17:18': 'Were none found who returned to [a]give glory to God except this foreigner?',
'17:19': 'And He said to him, Rise up and go; your [a]faith has [1]healed you.',
'17:20': 'And when He was questioned by the [a]Pharisees <I>as</I> <I>to</I> [b]when the kingdom of God was coming, He answered them and said, The [1c]kingdom of God does [2]not come with observation;',
'17:21': 'Nor will they say, Behold, [a]here <I>it</I> <I>is</I>! or, There! For behold, the [1]kingdom of God is in the midst of [2]you.',
'17:22': 'And He said to the disciples, The [a]days will come when you will long to see one of the [b]days of the Son of Man, and you will [1]not see <I>it</I>.',
'17:23': 'And they will say to you, Behold, there! Behold, here! Do not go away, nor run after <I>them</I>.',
'17:24': 'For just as [1]lightning flashing from <I>one</I> <I>end</I> [2]of heaven shines to the <I>other</I> <I>end</I> [2]of heaven, so will the Son of Man be in His [a]day.',
'17:25': 'But first He must suffer many things and be [a]rejected by this generation.',
'17:26': '[1a]And even as it happened in the [2b]days of Noah, so will it be also in the [c]days of the Son of Man:',
'17:27': 'They were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the [a]ark and the [b]flood came and destroyed them all.',

'18:8': 'I tell you that He will carry out their avenging quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man [1a]comes, will He find [2]faith on the earth?',
'18:9': 'And [1]He told this parable also to certain ones who [a]trusted in themselves that they were [b]righteous and despised the rest:',
'18:10': 'Two men [a]went up to the temple to pray, the one a [b]Pharisee and the other a tax collector.',
'18:11': 'The Pharisee [a]stood and prayed these things to himself: God, I thank You that I am [1]not like the rest of men&mdash;extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.',
'18:12': 'I [1a]fast twice a [2]week; I [b]give a tenth of all that I get.',

'18:15': 'And they were bringing to Him also their [a]babies that He might touch them. But when the disciples saw <I>this</I> they [b]rebuked them.',
'18:16': 'But Jesus called them to <I>Him</I>, saying, Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not [1a]forbid them, for of such is the [2b]kingdom of God.',
'18:17': 'Truly I say to you, Whoever does not receive the [a]kingdom of God like a [1b]little child shall by no means enter into it.',
'18:18': 'And a [1]certain ruler questioned Him, [a]saying, Good Teacher, [2]what shall I do to [b]inherit [c]eternal life?',

'18:23': 'But when he [a]heard these things, he became very sorrowful, for he was exceedingly rich.',
'18:24': 'And Jesus, seeing that he became very sorrowful, said, How difficult it is for those who have [a]riches to go into the kingdom of God.',
'18:25': 'For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a [1]needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.',

'19:5': 'And as He came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, Zaccheus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house.',
'19:6': 'And he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.',
'19:7': 'And when they saw <I>it</I>, they all [a]murmured, saying, He has gone in to lodge with a sinful man.',

'19:15': 'And when he came back, having received the kingdom, he commanded that those slaves to whom he had given the money should be called to him so that he might know what they had gained by doing business.',
'19:16': 'And the first appeared, saying, Master, your mina has gained ten minas.',
'19:17': 'And he said to him, Well <I>done</I>, good slave. Because you have become [a]faithful in the least, [1]have authority [b]over ten cities.',

'19:22': 'He said to him, Out of your mouth I will [1]judge you, [a]wicked slave. You knew that I am a harsh man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.',
'19:23': 'Why then did you not put my money [1]in the bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?',

'23:50': 'And behold, there was a man named [1a]Joseph, who was a member of the Council, and a good and righteous man',
'23:51': '(This man had not consented to their counsel and action), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was [a]expecting the kingdom of God.',
'23:52': 'This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.',
'23:53': 'And he took <I>it</I> down and wrapped it in a fine linen cloth, and [1]laid Him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where [a]no one had ever lain.',
'23:54': 'And it was the day of [1]preparation, and the Sabbath was [2]coming on.',
'23:55': 'And the women who had come together with Him out of Galilee followed after and beheld the tomb and how His body was laid.',
'23:56': 'And they returned and prepared [a]spices and [b]ointment. And on the [c]Sabbath they [1]rested according to the commandment.',
'24:1': 'Now [a]on the [1]first day of the week, at early dawn, [2]they [3]came to the tomb, bringing the [b]spices which they had prepared.',
'24:2': 'And they found the [a]stone rolled away from the tomb;',
'24:3': 'But when they entered, they did [a]not find the body of the Lord Jesus.',
'24:4': 'And while they <I>stood</I> perplexed about this, behold, [a]two [b]men stood by them in [1c]dazzling clothing.',
'24:5': 'And they became [a]frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, and <I>the</I> <I>men</I> said to them, Why are you seeking the [b]living One among the dead?',
'24:6': 'He is not here but has been [1]raised. Remember how He [a]spoke to you while He was still in [b]Galilee,',
'24:7': 'Saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the [a]third day rise up.',
'24:8': 'And they [a]remembered His words.',
'24:9': 'And returning from the tomb, they [a]reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.',
'24:10': 'Now they were [a]Mary the Magdalene and [b]Joanna and [1]Mary the <I>mother</I> of James and the rest of the women with them, who told these things to the apostles.',
'24:11': 'And these words appeared [1]to them as [2]nonsense, and they did [a]not believe them.',
'24:12': 'But [a]Peter rose up and ran to the tomb; and stooping to look in, he saw the [b]linen cloths alone, and he went away to his own <I>home</I>, marveling at what had happened.',
'24:13': 'And behold, [a]two of them were going on the same day to a village named Emmaus, which was sixty [1]stadia away from Jerusalem.',
'24:14': 'And they were talking to each other concerning all these things which had occurred.',
'24:15': 'And while they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself drew near and [1]went with them.',
'24:16': 'But their eyes were [a]kept from recognizing Him.',
'24:17': 'And He said to them, What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking? And they stood still, looking sad.',
'24:18': 'And one <I>of</I> <I>them</I>, Cleopas by name, answered and said to Him, Do You alone dwell as a stranger in Jerusalem and not know the things which have taken place in it in these days?',
'24:19': 'And He said to them, What things? And they [1]said to Him, The things concerning Jesus the [a]Nazarene, who was a [2b]Prophet [c]powerful in work and word before God and all the people;',
'24:20': 'And how the chief priests and our [a]rulers [b]delivered Him up to the [c]sentence of death and [d]crucified Him.',
'24:21': 'But we were hoping that He was the One who was about to [a]redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all these things, it is <I>now</I> going on the third day since these things took place.',
'24:22': 'But moreover some [a]women from among us amazed us. Being at the tomb early',
'24:23': 'And [a]not finding His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of [b]angels, who said that He is [c]living.',
'24:24': 'And some of those with us went to the [a]tomb and found <I>it</I> even as the women also said, but they did not see Him.',
'24:25': 'And He said to them, O [1a]foolish and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!',
'24:26': 'Was it not necessary for the Christ to [a]suffer these things and [1]enter into His [b]glory?',
'24:27': 'And beginning from [a]Moses and from all the [b]prophets, He explained to them clearly in [1]all the [c]Scriptures the things concerning [d]Himself.',
'24:28': 'And they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther.',
'24:29': 'And they constrained Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is near evening and the day is already gone by. And He went in to [a]stay with them.',
'24:30': 'And as He reclined <I>at</I> <I>table</I> with them, He took the loaf and [a]blessed <I>it</I>, and having broken <I>it</I>, He began handing <I>it</I> to them.',
'24:31': 'And their eyes were [1]opened, and they recognized Him; and [2]He disappeared from them.',
'24:32': 'And they said to one another, Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, while He was opening to us the [a]Scriptures?',
'24:33': 'And they rose up that very hour and returned to [1]Jerusalem, and they found the [a]eleven and those with them assembled together,',
'24:34': 'Saying, The Lord really has been raised and has [a]appeared to Simon.',
'24:35': 'And they related the things <I>that</I> <I>occurred</I> on the road, and how He was made [a]known to them in the breaking of the bread.',
'24:36': 'And as they were speaking these things, He Himself stood in their midst and said to them, [a]Peace to you.',
'24:37': 'But they were terrified and became [a]frightened and thought they beheld a [1]spirit.',
'24:38': 'And He said to them, Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your heart?',
'24:39': 'See My [a]hands and My feet, that <I>it</I> is I Myself. [b]Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have [1]flesh and bones as you behold Me having.',
'24:40': 'And when He had said this, He [a]showed them His hands and His feet.',
'24:41': 'And while they still [1]did not believe for [a]joy and were marveling, He said to them, Do you have anything here to [b]eat?',
'24:42': 'And they handed Him a piece of broiled [a]fish;',
'24:43': 'And He took <I>it</I> and [a]ate before them.',
'24:44': 'And He said to them, These are My words which I [a]spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the [1]Law of [b]Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.',
'24:45': 'Then He [1a]opened their mind to understand the Scriptures;',
'24:46': 'And He said to them, Thus it is [a]written, that the Christ would [b]suffer and rise up from the dead on the [c]third day,',
'24:47': 'And that repentance for [1a]forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His [b]name to all the [c]nations, beginning from [d]Jerusalem.',
'24:48': 'You are [a]witnesses of these things.',
'24:49': 'And behold, I send forth the [1a]promise of My Father upon you; but as for you, [2]stay in the city until you [3]put on [b]power from on [c]high.',
'24:50': 'And He led them out as far as [1a]Bethany, and He lifted up His hands and blessed them.',
'24:51': 'And while He blessed them, He parted from them and was [1]carried up into [a]heaven.',
'24:52': 'And they [a]worshipped Him and returned to [b]Jerusalem with great [c]joy,',
'24:53': 'And were continually in the [a]temple, [b]blessing God. [1]',

{sup:1, word:"me", lines:["The early church recognized Luke as the author of both this Gospel and the Acts. Luke&rsquo;s authorship is evident from the style of composition of the two books. Luke was a Gentile ({Col4:14|Col. 4:14}; cf. {Col4:11|Col. 4:11}), probably an Asiatic Greek, and a physician ({Col4:14|Col. 4:14}). Beginning in Troas, he joined Paul in his ministry and accompanied him in his last three ministry journeys ({Act16:10|Acts 16:10}-{Act16:17|17}; {Act20:5|20:5}&mdash;{Act21:18|21:18}; {Act27:1|27:1}&mdash;{Act28:15|28:15}). He was a faithful companion of Paul until Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom ({Phm1:24|Philem. 24}; {2Ti4:11|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:11}). Hence, his Gospel should represent Paul&rsquo;s views, as Mark&rsquo;s represents Peter&rsquo;s (see {Mrk1:1^1P1|note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 1}, in {Mrk1|Mark 1}).","The Gospels of Luke, Matthew, and Mark are synoptic in regard to the Savior&rsquo;s humanity (see {Mrk1:1^1P2|note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 2}, in {Mrk1|Mark 1}). Luke&rsquo;s Gospel reveals God among men in His saving grace given to fallen mankind. Its purpose is to present the Savior as a genuine, normal, and perfect man. It gives a complete genealogy of the man Jesus, from His parents back to Adam, the first generation of mankind, and shows that He is a genuine descendant of man&mdash;a son of man (see {Mat1:1^1P2|note 1<sup>1</sup>, pars. 2} and {Mat1:1^1P3|3}, in {Mat1|Matt. 1}). Its record of the life of this man impresses us with the completeness and perfection of His humanity. Hence, this Gospel stresses the Lord as the Man-Savior. Based on the moral principles that apply to all men, it presents gospel messages, as in {Luk4:16|4:16}-{Luk4:21|21}; {Luk7:41|7:41}-{Luk7:43|43}; {Luk12:14|12:14}-{Luk12:21|21}; and {Luk13:2|13:2}-{Luk13:5|5}; gospel parables, as in {Luk10:30|10:30}-{Luk10:37|37}; {Luk14:16|14:16}-{Luk14:24|24}; {Luk15:3|15:3}-{Luk15:32|32}; and {Luk18:9|18:9}-{Luk18:14|14}; and gospel cases, as in {Luk7:36|7:36}-{Luk7:50|50}; {Luk13:10|13:10}-{Luk13:17|17}; {Luk16:19|16:19}-{Luk16:31|31}; {Luk19:1|19:1}-{Luk19:10|10}; and {Luk23:39|23:39}-{Luk23:43|43}. None of these are recorded in the other Gospels. In contrast to Matthew, Luke does not stress the dispensational aspect or the Jewish background. It is the Gospel written to mankind in general, and it announces the good news to all people ({Luk2:10|2:10}). Its characteristic is absolutely not Jewish but Gentile ({Luk4:25|4:25}-{Luk4:28|28}). It is a Gospel to all sinners, both Jewish and Gentile. As such, the sequence of its record is according to morality, not according to historical events. See notes {Mat8:16^1P2|16<sup>1</sup>, par. 2}, in {Mat8|Matt. 8} and {Mrk14:20^1|20<sup>1</sup>} in {Mrk14|Mark 14}."]},

According to this verse, it seems that the Holy Spirit would be only upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the holy child. However, {Mat1:18|Matt. 1:18} and {Mat1:20|20} tell us that Mary &ldquo;was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been begotten in Mary&rsquo;s womb before she delivered the child Jesus. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, which produced a God-man, One who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced. This is the most wonderful and most excellent person of Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior.","The conception of John the Baptist was strikingly different in essence from that of Jesus the Savior. The conception of the Baptist was God&rsquo;s miracle, accomplished with the overage human essence, merely by the divine power without the involvement of the divine essence. This resulted in the bringing forth of a mere man who was filled with the Spirit of God ({Luk1:15|v. 15}) but who lacked the nature of God.

A sinner in darkness needs to receive sight that he may realize that he needs salvation ({Act26:18|Acts 26:18}).","What is covered in {Luk18:35|18:35}&mdash;{Luk19:10|19:10} shows how one can fulfill the conditions revealed in vv. {Luk18:9|9}-{Luk18:30|30} for entering the kingdom of God&mdash;first, one must receive sight from the Savior (vv. {Luk18:35|35}-{Luk18:43|43}), and then one must receive the Savior as the dynamic salvation ({Luk19:1|19:1}-{Luk19:10|10}). In this way the blind man could be like the repenting tax collector and the unoccupied little child and receive the Savior, and Zaccheus could renounce all his riches and follow Him. The way to enter into all spiritual things is to receive sight from the Lord and to receive the Lord Himself."]},
