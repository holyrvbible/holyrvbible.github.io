'1:3': 'We give thanks to God, the [1]Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always concerning you,',
'1:4': 'Because we have heard of your [1a]faith in Christ Jesus and the [1b]love which you have unto all the saints',
'1:5': 'Because of the [1a]hope [2]laid up for you in the heavens, of which you heard before in the [b]word of the [3]truth of the gospel,',
'1:6': 'Which has come to you, even as it is also in all the world, bearing fruit and growing, as also in you, since the day you heard and knew the [1a]grace of God in [2b]truth;',
'1:7': 'Even as you learned from [a]Epaphras, our beloved fellow slave, who is a faithful [1b]minister of Christ on your behalf,',
'1:8': 'Who also has made known to us your [a]love in the Spirit.',
'1:9': 'Therefore we also, since the day we heard of <I>it</I>, do not cease [a]praying and asking on your behalf that you may be filled with the full knowledge of [1]His [b]will in all [2]spiritual [c]wisdom and understanding,',
'1:10': 'To [1]walk worthily of the Lord to please <I>Him</I> [2]in all things, [3]bearing fruit in every good work and growing by the full [4]knowledge of God,',

'1:15': 'Who is the [1a]image of the [b]invisible God, the [2c]Firstborn of all creation,',
'1:16': 'Because [1]in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether [2]thrones or [3a]lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created [4b]through Him and [5]unto Him.',
'1:17': 'And He is [1]before all things, and all things [2a]cohere in Him;',
'1:18': 'And He is the [a]Head of the [b]Body, the church; He is the [c]beginning, the [1d]Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things;',

'2:3': 'In whom all the treasures of [1a]wisdom and knowledge are hidden.',
'2:4': 'This I say that no one may [1]delude you with [2a]persuasive speech.',
'2:5': 'For even though I am absent in the flesh, yet in the [1a]spirit I am with you, rejoicing and seeing your order and the solid basis of your faith [2]in Christ.',
'2:6': 'As therefore you have [1a]received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, [2b]walk in Him,',
'2:7': 'Having been [1a]rooted and being [b]built up in Him, and being established [2]in the faith even as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.',
'2:8': 'Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his [1]philosophy and [a]empty deceit, according to the [2b]tradition of men, according to the [3c]elements of the world, and not according to [4d]Christ;',
'2:9': 'For in Him dwells all the [1a]fullness of the [2]Godhead [3]bodily,',
'2:10': 'And you have been made [1]full in Him, who is the [a]Head of all [2]rule and authority.',

'2:13': 'And you, though [1a]dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He [2b]made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses;',
'2:14': '[1a]Wiping out the [2]handwriting in [3]ordinances, which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, [4]nailing it to the cross.',
'2:15': '[1]Stripping off the [2a]rulers and the authorities, [3]He made a [4]display <I>of</I> <I>them</I> openly, triumphing over them in [5]it.',
'2:16': 'Let no one therefore judge you [1]in [a]eating and in drinking or in respect of a [2b]feast or of a [3c]new moon or of the [4d]Sabbath,',
'2:17': 'Which are a [1a]shadow of the things to come, but the [2]body is of [3b]Christ.',
'2:18': 'Let no one [1]defraud you by judging you unworthy of your [a]prize, in [b]self-chosen [2]lowliness and the worship of the angels, [3]dwelling on the things which he has [4]seen, vainly [c]puffed up by [5]his mind set on the flesh,',
'2:19': 'And [1]not [a]holding the Head, [2b]out from whom all the [3]Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the [4]joints and [5]sinews, [6]grows with the [7]growth of God.',
'2:20': '[1]If you [2a]died with Christ from the [3b]elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves to [c]ordinances:',
'2:21': '[1]Do not handle, nor taste, nor touch,',
'2:22': '<I>(Regarding</I> things which are all to [1a]perish when [2]used) according to the [b]commandments and teachings of men?',
'2:23': '[1]Such things indeed have a [2]reputation of wisdom in self-imposed [a]worship and lowliness and [3b]severe treatment of the body, <I>but</I> are [4]not of any value against the [c]indulgence of the flesh.',
'3:1': '[1]If therefore you were [2a]raised together with Christ, seek the things which are [3]above, where Christ is, sitting at the [b]right hand of God.',
'3:2': 'Set your [a]mind on the things which are above, not on the [1]things which are on the earth.',
'3:3': 'For you [1a]died, and your [2]life is [3]hidden with Christ in God.',
'3:4': 'When [1]Christ our [2a]life is [b]manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in [c]glory.',
'3:5': '[1a]Put to death therefore your [2b]members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and [c]greediness, which is idolatry;',
'3:6': 'Because of which things the [a]wrath of God is coming upon the [b]sons of disobedience;',
'3:7': 'In which you also once walked, when you lived in these things.',
'3:8': 'But now, you also, put away all <I>these</I> things: wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, [a]foul abusive language out of your mouth.',
'3:9': 'Do not [a]lie to one another, since you have [1b]put off the [2c]old man with his practices',
'3:10': 'And have [1a]put on the [2b]new man, which is being [3c]renewed unto full knowledge according to the [4d]image of Him [5]who [e]created him,',
'3:11': '[1]Where there [2]cannot be [3]Greek and [a]Jew, [4b]circumcision and uncircumcision, [5c]barbarian, [6]Scythian, [7]slave, [8]free man, but [9d]Christ is [10]all and in [10]all.',
'3:12': '[1]Put on therefore, as God&rsquo;s [a]chosen ones, [2]holy and beloved, [b]inward parts of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, long-suffering;',
'3:13': 'Bearing one another and [a]forgiving [1]one another, if anyone should have a complaint against anyone; even as the [2]Lord forgave you, so also <I>should</I> you <I>forgive</I>.',
'3:14': 'And over all these things <I>put</I> <I>on</I> [1a]love, which is the uniting bond of [2]perfectness.',
'3:15': 'And let the [1a]peace of Christ [2]arbitrate in your hearts, to [3]which [4]also you were called in [b]one Body; and be [5c]thankful.',
'3:16': 'Let the [1a]word of Christ [2b]dwell in you [3]richly [4]in all wisdom, [5]teaching and admonishing [6]one another with [7c]psalms <I>and</I> hymns <I>and</I> [d]spiritual songs, [5]singing with [8]grace in your hearts to God.',
'3:17': 'And whatever you do in word or in deed, <I>do</I> all things in the [1]name of the Lord Jesus, giving [a]thanks to God the Father through Him.',
'3:18': '[1a]Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.',
'3:19': 'Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them.',
'3:20': 'Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.',
'3:21': 'Fathers, do not vex your children, that they may not be disheartened.',
'3:22': 'Slaves, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart fearing the Lord.',
'3:23': 'Whatever you do, work from the soul as to the Lord and not to men,',
'3:24': 'Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the [1]inheritance as [a]recompense. You [2]serve the Lord Christ.',

'4:1': 'Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.',
'4:2': '[1a]Persevere in [2]prayer, [3]watching in it with thanksgiving,',

Originally, Christ was the unique element in the church life, yet at that time a disturbance was created because Christ was being replaced by culture. The constituent of the church should be Christ and Christ alone, yet the church had been invaded by certain elements of culture&mdash;especially religion, in the form of asceticism related to Judaic ordinances and observances ({Col2:16|2:16}, {Col2:20|20}-{Col2:21|21}), and philosophy, in the form of mysticism related to Gnosticism and the worship of angels ({Col2:8|2:8}, {Col2:18|18}).
