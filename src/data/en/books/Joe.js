'1:12': 'The vine is dried up,<br>And the fig tree languishes,<br>The pomegranate and the palm and the apple tree&mdash;<br>All the trees of the field are dried up;<br>Indeed gladness has withered away<br>From the children of men.',
'1:13': 'Gird yourselves and lament, O priests;<br>Howl, O ministers of the altar.<br>Come, pass the night in [a]sackcloth,<br>O ministers of my God.<br>For the meal offering and the drink offering<br>Are held back from the house of your God.',
'1:14': 'Sanctify a [a]fast;<br>Call a solemn assembly;<br>Gather the elders<br>And all the inhabitants of the land<br>To the house of Jehovah your God;<br>And cry unto Jehovah.',

'1:20': 'The beasts of the field also<br>Cry to You,<br>For the waterways<br>Are dried up,<br>And fire has devoured<br>The pastures of the wilderness.',
'2:1': 'Blow a [a]trumpet in Zion;<br>Sound an alarm in My holy mountain;<br>Let all the inhabitants of the land tremble,<br>For the [b]day of Jehovah comes;<br>For it draws near:',
'2:2': '[a]A day of [b]darkness and gloominess,<br>A day of clouds and deep darkness,<br>Like the dawn spread over the mountains&mdash;<br>A [c]people great and mighty.<br>[d]There has not been any like them<br>Since eternity,<br>And there will not be any more after them,<br>Even until the years of the generation of the generations.',
'2:3': 'A [a]fire devours before them,<br>And after them a flame blazes.<br>Before them the land is like the garden of [b]Eden,<br>After them, like a desolate [c]wilderness;<br>And indeed no one escapes them.',
'2:4': 'Their appearance is like the appearance of [a]horses;<br>And as horsemen, so they run.',
'2:5': 'Like the [a]sound of chariots<br>Upon the mountaintops they leap,<br>Like the sound of a flame of fire<br>That devours the stubble,<br>Like a mighty people<br>Set in battle array.',

'2:8': 'Nor do they crowd each other;<br>They march, each on his highway.<br>Though they fall among weapons,<br>They do not break off their progress.',
'2:9': 'They rush at the city;<br>They run against the wall;<br>They go up into the houses;<br>In through the windows<br>They go, like a thief.',
'2:10': 'The earth [a]quakes before them;<br>The heavens shake;<br>The [b]sun and the moon grow dark,<br>And the stars withdraw their shining.',
'2:11': 'And Jehovah utters His voice<br>Before His army,<br>For His camp is very great,<br>For He who executes His word is mighty.<br>For the [a]day of Jehovah is great<br>And very terrible,<br>And who can endure it?',
'2:12': 'Yet even now,<br>Declares Jehovah,<br>[a]Turn to Me with all your heart<br>And with fasting and weeping and mourning;',
'2:13': 'And rend your [a]hearts,<br>And not your [b]garments,<br>And turn to Jehovah your God,<br>For He is gracious and [c]compassionate,<br>Long-suffering and abundant in lovingkindness<br>And repentant of evil.',
'2:14': '[a]Who knows whether He will turn and repent<br>And leave a blessing behind Him,<br>A [1]meal offering and a [1]drink offering<br>To Jehovah your God?',
'2:15': '[1]Blow a [a]trumpet in Zion;<br>[2]Sanctify a [b]fast;<br>Call a [3]solemn assembly;',
'2:16': 'Gather the people;<br>Sanctify the congregation;<br>Assemble the elders;<br>Gather the children<br>And those who suck the breasts;<br>Let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber,<br>And the bride from her canopy.',
'2:17': 'Let the [a]priests, the ministers of Jehovah,<br>Weep between the porch and the [b]altar,<br>And let them say,<br>Look with pity, O Jehovah, upon Your people;<br>And do not give Your inheritance over to reproach,<br>That the nations should rule over them.<br>[c]Why should they say among the peoples,<br>Where is their God?',
'2:18': 'Then Jehovah became jealous for [1]His land,<br>And He spared His people.',
'2:19': 'And Jehovah answered and said to His people,<br>I am about to send you<br>The [a]grain and the new wine and the fresh oil,<br>And you will be satisfied with it;<br>And I will no longer make you<br>A reproach among the nations,',
'2:20': 'But the [a]northern army<br>I will remove far from you;<br>And I will drive it into a land<br>Barren and desolate,<br>With its face toward the eastern sea<br>And its end toward the western sea.<br>And its [b]stench will go up,<br>And its foul smell will go up,<br>For it has done great things.',
'2:21': 'Do not fear, O land;<br>Be glad and rejoice,<br>For Jehovah has done great things.',
'2:22': 'Do not fear, O beasts of the field,<br>For the pastures of the wilderness turn green.<br>For the tree bears its fruit;<br>The fig tree and the vine yield their strength.',
'2:23': 'O children of Zion,<br>Be glad and rejoice<br>In Jehovah your God.<br>For He gives you<br>The [a]early rain in righteousness,<br>And He makes the rain come down for you:<br>The [1]early rain and the [1]late rain<br>At the beginning of the season.',
'2:24': 'And the threshing floors will be full of grain,<br>And the wine vats will overflow with new wine and fresh oil.',
'2:25': 'And I will restore to you the years<br>That the swarming [a]locust has eaten,<br>The licking locust and the consuming locust and the cutting locust,<br>My great army<br>That I sent among you.',
'2:26': 'And you will eat to the [a]full and be satisfied,<br>And you will praise the name of Jehovah your God,<br>Who has dealt wondrously with you;<br>And My people will never be ashamed.',
'2:27': 'And you will know that I am in the [a]midst of Israel,<br>And that I am Jehovah your [b]God and there is none else.<br>And My people will never be ashamed.',
'2:28': '[a]And afterward I will [1]pour out My [b]Spirit upon all flesh,<br>And your sons and your daughters shall prophesy;<br>Your old men shall dream dreams;<br>Your young men shall see visions.',
'2:29': 'Indeed even upon the male and female slaves<br>In those days I will pour out My [a]Spirit.',
'2:30': 'And I will [1]show [a]wonders in the heavens and on earth:<br>Blood and [b]fire and pillars of [c]smoke.',
'2:31': 'The [a]sun shall be turned into darkness,<br>And the moon into blood,<br>Before the great and terrible<br>[1b]Day of Jehovah comes.',
'2:32': 'And everyone who [1a]calls on the name of Jehovah shall be saved;<br>For in Mount [b]Zion and in Jerusalem will be an escape,<br>As Jehovah has said,<br>Even for the [c]remnant<br>Whom Jehovah [d]calls.',
'3:1': 'For indeed, in those days and at that time<br>When I [a]turn the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,',
'3:2': 'I will [1a]gather all the nations<br>And will bring them down to the [b]valley of [2]Jehoshaphat;<br>And I will enter into [3]judgment with them there<br>Because of My people and My inheritance Israel,<br>Whom they have scattered among the nations.<br>And they have divided My land',
'3:3': 'And have cast lots for My people;<br>And they have given a boy for a prostitute<br>And sold a girl for wine to drink.',
'3:4': 'Indeed then, what are you to Me, Tyre and Sidon<br>And all the regions of Philistia?<br>Will you repay Me with a recompense?<br>But if you recompense Me,<br>Swiftly, speedily,<br>I will return your recompense upon your own head.',
'3:5': 'In that you have taken My silver and My gold,<br>And have brought My fine precious things into your temples,',
'3:6': 'And have sold to the children of the [1]Javanim<br>The children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem,<br>In order to remove them<br>Far from their borders;',
'3:7': 'I will rouse them out of the place<br>To which you have sold them,<br>And will return your recompense upon your own head.',
'3:8': 'And I will sell your sons and your daughters<br>Into the hand of the children of Judah,<br>And they will sell them to the Sabeans,<br>To a nation that is far off,<br>For Jehovah has spoken.',
'3:9': 'Proclaim this among the [a]nations:<br>Prepare the battle;<br>[b]Rouse the mighty men;<br>Let all the men of battle<br>Draw near; let them go up.',

'3:11': 'Hurry and come,<br>All you surrounding nations,<br>And be gathered.<br>There cause Your [1]mighty ones to [a]descend, O Jehovah!',
'3:12': 'Let the nations rouse themselves and come up<br>To the [a]valley of Jehoshaphat.<br>For there I will sit to judge<br>All the surrounding [b]nations.',
'3:13': 'Send forth the [a]sickle,<br>For the harvest is ripe;<br>Come, tread,<br>For the [b]winepress is full;<br>The wine vats overflow,<br>For their evil is great.',
'3:14': 'Multitudes, multitudes,<br>In the valley of decision;<br>For the [a]day of Jehovah has drawn near<br>In the valley of decision.',
'3:15': 'The [a]sun and the moon grow dark,<br>And the stars withdraw their shining.',

'3:17': 'Thus you will know that I am Jehovah your God,<br>[a]Dwelling in Zion, My [b]holy mountain.<br>And Jerusalem will be holy,<br>And strangers will pass through her no longer.',
'3:18': 'And in that day<br>[1]The mountains will drop down [a]fresh wine,<br>And the hills will [b]flow with milk;<br>And all the waterways of Judah<br>Will flow with water,<br>And a [2c]fountain will go forth from the house of Jehovah,<br>And it will water the valley of Shittim.',
'3:19': '[1a]Egypt will be a desolation,<br>And [b]Edom will be a desolate wilderness,<br>Because of the violence against the children of Judah,<br>In that they have shed innocent blood in their land.',

'3:21': 'And I will acquit them of their bloodshed that I had not acquitted them of,<br>For Jehovah [a]dwells in Zion.',

{sup:1, word:"cutting", lines:["Four words for locust are used in this verse, probably referring to one kind of locust in various stages of growth. The four stages of this one kind of locust refer to the nations that devastated Israel in four consecutive empires: Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome, including Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire ({Rev17:8|Rev. 17:8}-{Rev17:11|11}). The armies of these empires were like locusts ({Joe2:25|2:25}) coming to devastate and consume Israel totally, devouring her people, land, fields, produce, food, and drink and cutting off her offerings. These empires correspond to the four sections of the great human image in {Dan2|Dan. 2}, to the four beasts in {Dan7|Dan. 7}, and to the four horns in {Zec1|Zech. 1}. They will be overcome and terminated by Christ, who will set up the kingdom and reign among the saved Israel in the age of restoration ({Joe3|ch. 3}; {Dan2:34|Dan. 2:34}-{Dan2:35|35} and {Dan2:34^1|notes}).","Beginning approximately two hundred years before the coming of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, God sent the prophets to warn Israel, to advise them, and to call them to return to God. However, Israel did not listen to the prophets. This forced God to send the four kinds of locusts to chastise His people. Israel has been suffering the cutting, swarming, licking, and consuming of the locusts for twenty-seven centuries. God&rsquo;s purpose in allowing Israel to suffer under the locusts was to bring forth a couple, Joseph and Mary, so that God could be born in man, of man, and out of man to become no longer only God but a God-man (cf. {Mat1|Matt. 1}). Hence, God used the suffering of the Jews to bring in the incarnation, an unprecedented event that brought God into man and mingled God and man as one. Furthermore, God has used the locusts to afford all the necessary facilities in the environment for the carrying out of His purpose. The Roman Empire, the aggregate of the four empires, afforded everything necessary for the incarnated God to live and move and work on earth. It also provided the means for Christ to be crucified for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s redemption ({Joh18:31|John 18:31}-{Joh18:32|32}), the occasion for the pouring out of the Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God upon all flesh to produce the church as the organic Body of Christ ({Act2|Acts 2}), and the facilities for the spreading of the gospel to the entire inhabited earth ({Mat28:19|Matt. 28:19}; {Act1:8|Acts 1:8}).","The Bible is a record of two histories: the history of man, the human history, and the history of God, the divine history. The former is like an outward shell, and the latter, like the kernel within the shell. In the Minor Prophets the human history is clearly defined and is signified by the four kinds of locusts mentioned in this verse. The divine history within the human history is also revealed in considerable detail. The divine history, as the divine mystery of the Triune God in humanity, began in eternity past with the eternal God and His eternal economy ({Mic5:2|Micah 5:2c}; {1Ti1:4|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:4}; {Eph1:4|Eph. 1:4}-{Eph1:5|5}, {Eph1:9|9}-{Eph1:11|11}). It continues with Christ&rsquo;s incarnation ({Mic5:2|Micah 5:2a}); His death, burial, and resurrection for the spreading of God&rsquo;s redemption and salvation to all the nations on earth ({Jon1:17|Jonah 1:17}; {Jon2:10|2:10}); His pouring out of the consummated Spirit to produce the church as the corporate expression of the Triune God ({Joe2:28|2:28}-{Joe2:32|32}); His second coming as the Desire of nations ({Hag2:7|Hag. 2:7a}) and as the Sun of righteousness ({Mal4:2|Mal. 4:2a}); His coming with His overcomers as His army to defeat Antichrist and his army ({Joe3:1|3:1}-{Joe3:15|15}); and His reigning in Zion in the thousand-year kingdom ({Joe3:16|3:16}-{Joe3:21|21}; {Mic4:7|Micah 4:7}). Eventually, the kingdom will consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity. The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate, the consummate, step of God&rsquo;s history."]},

{sup:1, word:"pour", lines:["This prophecy concerning the pouring out of God&rsquo;s Spirit as the early rain for Israel&rsquo;s salvation was fulfilled as a foretaste by the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost ({Act2:1|Acts 2:1}-{Act2:4|4}, {Act2:16|16}-{Act2:21|21}), and it will be fulfilled as a full taste by the pouring out of the Spirit a second time, before the great tribulation ({Mat24:21|Matt. 24:21}), for the salvation and regeneration of many of the returned Israelites. This second outpouring is different from the pouring out of the Spirit as the late rain on the last day of the tribulation for the salvation of the remnant of the Jews under Antichrist&rsquo;s besieging ({Zec12:10|Zech. 12:10}).","In the Bible and in the Minor Prophets four things are unveiled: God&rsquo;s chastisement on His elect people, God&rsquo;s punishment of the nations, the manifestation of Christ, and the restoration. These four matters are covered in Joel, a short book of three chapters. First, God sent the locusts to consume Israel ({Joe1:2|1:2}&mdash;{Joe2:11|2:11}). This was God&rsquo;s chastisement because of Israel&rsquo;s great evils. Then, this book reveals that God will punish and judge the Gentile nations because in their consuming of Israel they are excessive, acting without regard for justice ({Joe3:1|3:1}-{Joe3:16|16a}, {Joe3:19|19}). God&rsquo;s chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations issue in the manifestation of Christ. Regarding this manifestation, Joel speaks here concerning the outpouring of the processed, consummated, compound Spirit, i.e., the Spirit of God compounded with Christ&rsquo;s humanity, Christ&rsquo;s death and its effectiveness, and Christ&rsquo;s resurrection with its power (see {Exo30:25^1|note 25<sup>1</sup>} in {Exo30|Exo. 30}). This is the Holy Spirit, who was poured out on the day of Pentecost ({Act2:1|Acts 2:1}-{Act2:4|4}, {Act2:16|16}-{Act2:21|21}), and this Spirit is the consummated Triune God and the realization of Christ for the manifestation of Christ. This manifestation began with the incarnation of Christ and has been confirmed and strengthened by the outpouring of the Spirit, for through that outpouring the individual Christ became the corporate Christ ({1Co12:12|1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12}-{1Co12:13|13}), the church as the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh ({1Ti3:15|1&nbsp;Tim. 3:15}-{1Ti3:16|16}). The church as the manifestation of Christ will bring in the glorious day of restoration, the age of the millennial kingdom ({Joe3:16|3:16}-{Joe3:21|21}), in which Christ will be manifested in a fuller way. The restoration will consummate in the fullest manifestation of Christ in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth ({Rev21:1|Rev. 21:1}-{Rev21:2|2}). See {Joe1:4^1|note 4<sup>1</sup>} in {Joe1|ch. 1}."]},

It will take place before the fifth trumpet, the first of the three woes ({Rev8:13|Rev. 8:13} and {Rev8:13^1|note}), which are the major structure of the great tribulation, in the great and terrible day of Jehovah ({Joe2:31|v. 31b}). See {Rev6:12^1|note 12<sup>1</sup>} in {Rev6|Rev. 6}.","In spite of such an outpouring of the Spirit, many of the returned Jews will not believe but will continue to be stubborn. Eventually, during the tribulation, Jerusalem will be surrounded by the Gentile armies under Antichrist, whose intention will be to destroy Israel entirely ({Zec14:2|Zech. 14:2}; {Rev16:13|Rev. 16:13}-{Rev16:16|16}). At that juncture the Lord Jesus Christ will descend with His overcomers, His mighty ones ({Joe3:11|3:11}). Furthermore, according to {Zec12:10|Zech. 12:10}, at that time the consummated Spirit will again be poured out, and the remnant of the children of Israel will be saved. Thus, the three outpourings of the Holy Spirit&mdash;on the day of Pentecost, just before the great tribulation, and at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming&mdash;work together for the salvation of Israel."]},
