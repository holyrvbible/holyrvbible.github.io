['Time of Writing', 'According to the way of Job&rsquo;s nomadic living ({Job1:3|1:3}) and the way he offered the burnt offering for his children, it seems that this book was written at the time of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob ({Job1:5|v. 5}; {Gen22:13|Gen. 22:13}; {Gen31:54|31:54}), about 2000 B.C., five hundred years before Moses wrote the Pentateuch.'],
['Place of Writing', 'The land of Uz ({Job1:1|1:1}), an area associated with Edom ({Lam4:21|Lam. 4:21}), west of the Arabian desert.'],
['Time Period Covered', 'The period of time that this book covers cannot be determined with accuracy; however, after his trials Job lived another 140 years ({Job42:16|42:16}), making the period of this book close to two hundred years, somewhere around 2000 B.C.'],

verses: {
'1:1': '[1]There was a man in the land of [2]Uz whose name was [3a]Job; and this man was [4b]perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil.',
'1:2': 'And [a]seven sons and three daughters were born to him.',
'1:3': 'And his possessions were seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred female donkeys and a great many servants; and this man was greater than all the sons of the east.',
'1:4': 'And his sons would go and hold feasts in each one&rsquo;s house, each on his own day, and they would send word and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.',
'1:5': 'And when the days of feasting ran their course, Job would send word and [1]sanctify them; and he would rise early in the morning and offer [1a]burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, Perhaps my children have sinned and have [2]cursed God in their heart. Job did this continually.',
'1:6': 'Then one day, when the [1a]sons of God came to present themselves [b]before Jehovah, [2c]Satan also came [3]among them.',
'1:7': 'And Jehovah said to Satan, Where have you come from? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From [a]roving the earth and going about in it.',
'1:8': 'And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you [1]considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a [a]perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil.',
'1:9': 'Then Satan [a]answered Jehovah and said, [1]Does Job fear God without cause?',
'1:10': 'Have You not set a [a]hedge around him and his household and all that he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his possessions are spread throughout the land.',
'1:11': 'But stretch forth Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face.',
'1:12': 'And Jehovah said to Satan, Here is all that he has, in your hand; [1]only do not stretch forth your hand against him.<br class="split">And Satan went forth from Jehovah&rsquo;s presence.',
'1:13': 'Then one day, when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother,',
'1:14': 'A messenger came to Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the donkeys were feeding beside them;',
'1:15': 'And the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you.',
'1:16': 'While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The [1]fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and devoured them; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you.',
'1:17': 'While this one was still speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans formed three companies and raided the camels and took them, and they struck the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you.',
'1:18': 'While this one was still speaking, another came and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their firstborn brother;',
'1:19': 'And suddenly a great wind came from beyond the desert and struck the four corners of the house, so that it fell upon the young people and they died; and I alone have escaped to relate these things to you.',
'1:20': 'Then Job rose up and tore his clothes and shaved his head and fell to the earth and worshipped.',
'1:21': 'And he said,<br>[a]Naked I came out of my mother&rsquo;s womb,<br>And naked I will [b]return there.<br>Jehovah [c]gives and Jehovah takes away;<br>Blessed be the name of Jehovah.',
'1:22': 'In all this Job did [a]not sin, nor did he charge God with unseemliness.',
'2:1': '[a]Then one day, when the [1]sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, [2b]Satan also came among them to present himself before Jehovah.',
'2:2': 'And Jehovah said to Satan, Where have you come from? And Satan answered Jehovah and said, From [a]roving the earth and going about in it.',
'2:3': 'And Jehovah said to Satan, Have you [1]considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his [a]integrity, though you have moved Me against him to destroy him without cause.',
'2:4': 'Then Satan [a]answered Jehovah and said, Skin for skin! Indeed all that a man has he will give for the sake of his life.',
'2:5': 'But stretch forth Your hand, and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will surely curse You to Your face.',
'2:6': 'And Jehovah said to [a]Satan, Here he is, in your hand; [1]only spare his life.',
'2:7': 'And Satan went forth from Jehovah&rsquo;s presence and struck Job with severe [a]boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.',
'2:8': 'And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and he sat among the ashes.',
'2:9': 'Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your [a]integrity? Curse God and die.',
'2:10': 'But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Should we receive the good from God but not receive the ill? In all this Job did [a]not sin with his lips.',
'2:11': 'Now when Job&rsquo;s three friends heard of all this misfortune that came upon him, each came from his place, Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite; and they together made an appointment to come to console him and comfort him.',
'2:12': 'And when they lifted up their eyes from a distance and did not recognize him, they lifted up their voice and wept; and they all tore their clothes and cast dust over their heads toward heaven.',
'2:13': 'And they sat with him on the ground [a]seven days and seven nights; but [1]none spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.',
'3:1': 'After this Job opened his mouth and [1a]cursed the day of his birth.',
'3:2': 'And Job responded and said,',
'3:3': 'Let the day on which I was born perish,<br>And the night which said, A man has been conceived.',
'3:4': 'Let that day be darkness;<br>Let God not seek it from above,<br>Nor let light shine upon it.',
'3:5': 'Let darkness and the shadow of death reclaim it;<br>Let a cloud dwell upon it;<br>Let the things that blacken the day terrify it.',
'3:6': 'As for that night, let deep darkness take hold of it;<br>Let it not rejoice among the days of the year;<br>Let it not come up in the number of the months.',
'3:7': 'Behold, let that night be barren;<br>Let no joyous shout come in it.',
'3:8': 'Let those curse it who curse the day,<br>Who are ready to rouse leviathan.',
'3:9': 'Let its predawn stars be dark;<br>Let it wait for light and there be none,<br>And do not let it see the eyelids of the dawn.',
'3:10': 'For it did not shut up the doors of the [a]womb that bore me,<br>Nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.',
'3:11': 'Why did I not [1]die at birth,<br>Come forth from the womb and expire?',
'3:12': 'Why did the knees receive me?<br>And why the breasts, that I should suck?',
'3:13': 'For now I would have lain down and been undisturbed;<br>I would have slept; then I would have been at rest',
'3:14': 'With kings and counselors of the earth,<br>Who rebuilt ruins for themselves;',
'3:15': 'Or with princes who had gold,<br>Who filled their houses with silver.',
'3:16': 'Or like a miscarriage that has been concealed, I would not have been,<br>Like infants that do not see the light.',
'3:17': 'There the wicked cease from their troubling,<br>And there the weary rest.',
'3:18': 'Captives are altogether at ease;<br>They do not hear the voice of the taskmaster.',
'3:19': 'The small and the great are there,<br>And the servant is free from his master.',
'3:20': 'Why does He give light to him who suffers<br>And life to the bitter in soul,',
'3:21': 'Who wait for [a]death, but it is not there;<br>And dig for it more than for hidden treasures;',
'3:22': 'Who rejoice to the point of exultation<br>And are glad when they have found the grave;',
'3:23': 'To the man whose way is hidden<br>And whom God has [a]hedged in?',
'3:24': 'For my sighing comes as my food,<br>And my groaning pours out like water.',
'3:25': 'For I dread something, and it comes upon me;<br>And what I fear comes to me.',
'3:26': 'I have no ease and I have no quiet<br>And I have no rest, but trouble comes.',
'4:1': 'Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,',
'4:2': 'If one attempts a word with you, will you be wearied by it?<br>But who can refrain from speaking?',
'4:3': 'Indeed, you have instructed many,<br>And you have strengthened the weak [a]hands.',
'4:4': 'Your words have raised up him who was stumbling,<br>And you have made the bowing [a]knees firm.',
'4:5': 'But now it comes to you, and you are wearied by it;<br>It touches you, and you are disturbed.',
'4:6': 'Is not your fear of God your confidence,<br>And the [a]integrity of your ways your hope?',
'4:7': 'Remember now, who, being innocent, has ever perished?<br>And where have the upright ever been cut off?',
'4:8': 'According to what I have seen, those who plow [1]iniquity<br>And those who [a]sow trouble reap the same.',
'4:9': 'By the [a]breath of God they perish,<br>And by the blast of His anger they are consumed.',
'4:10': 'The roaring of the lion and the sound of the fierce lion<br>And the teeth of the young lions are broken;',
'4:11': 'The strong lion perishes for lack of prey,<br>And the whelps of the lioness are scattered.',
'4:12': 'But a matter has stolen in unto me,<br>And my ear has received a whisper of it.',
'4:13': 'In perplexing thoughts of the night visions,<br>When deep sleep falls upon men,',
'4:14': 'Dread came upon me, and trembling,<br>And caused all my bones to dread.',
'4:15': 'And a spirit passed before my face;<br>The hair of my flesh bristled.',
'4:16': 'It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance;<br>A form stood before my eyes;<br>I heard a murmur of a voice:',
'4:17': 'Can a mortal man be more [a]righteous than God?<br>Can a man be purer than his Maker?',
'4:18': 'If He puts no trust in His servants,<br>And He charges His angels with [a]error,',
'4:19': 'How much more those who dwell in houses of clay,<br>Whose foundation is in [a]dust,<br>Who are crushed like a moth!',
'4:20': 'From morning to evening they are smashed to pieces;<br>Without any considering it, they [1]continually perish.',
'4:21': 'Should their tent cord be plucked up within them,<br>They die, and not in wisdom.',
'5:1': 'Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you?<br>And to which of the holy ones will you turn?',
'5:2': 'Surely [a]vexation slays the fool,<br>And jealousy kills the simpleton.',
'5:3': 'I have seen the fool taking root,<br>But suddenly I cursed his habitation.',
'5:4': 'His children are far from safety,<br>And they are crushed in the gate; and there is no one to deliver them.',
'5:5': 'The hungry eat his harvest<br>And [1]even take it out from the thorns,<br>And the [2]thirsty pant after [3]his wealth.',
'5:6': 'For evil does not come forth from the dust,<br>Nor does trouble spring forth from the ground.',
'5:7': 'But man is born unto [a]trouble,<br>Just as sparks fly upward.',
'5:8': 'But as for me, I would seek after God,<br>And I would commit my cause to God,',
'5:9': 'Who does great things that cannot be [a]searched,<br>Wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered;',
'5:10': 'Who gives [a]rain upon the surface of the earth<br>And sends water upon the surface of the fields;',
'5:11': 'Who sets on [a]high those who are lowly<br>And puts those who [b]mourn safely above all.',
'5:12': 'He frustrates the devices of the crafty,<br>So that their hands achieve no enterprise.',
'5:13': '[a]He seizes the [b]wise in their own craftiness,<br>And the counsel of the wily is brought to a sudden end.',
'5:14': 'By day they encounter darkness,<br>And at noon they grope about as in the night.',
'5:15': 'But He saves the needy from the sword of their mouth,<br>From the hand of the strong.',
'5:16': 'Thus the poor have hope,<br>And Injustice stops her mouth.',
'5:17': 'Indeed, [a]blessed is the man whom God corrects;<br>Therefore do not reject the [1b]chastening of the [2]Almighty.',
'5:18': 'For He wounds, but He binds up;<br>He strikes, but His hands [a]heal.',
'5:19': 'In six troubles He will deliver you;<br>Indeed in seven no evil will touch you.',
'5:20': 'In famine He will redeem you from death,<br>And in battle, from the power of the sword.',
'5:21': 'From the scourge of the tongue you will be hidden,<br>And you will not be afraid of destruction when it comes.',
'5:22': 'At destruction and at famine you will laugh,<br>And you will not be afraid of the animals of the earth.',
'5:23': 'For you will be in an alliance with the stones of the field,<br>And the animals of the field will be at peace with you.',
'5:24': 'And you will know that your tent is at peace,<br>And you will inspect your fold and miss nothing.',
'5:25': 'And you will know that your seed will be great,<br>And your offspring like the grass of the earth.',
'5:26': 'You will come to the grave at a ripe old age,<br>Like a shock of grain [1]coming up in its season.',
'5:27': 'This is it. We have searched it out; it is so.<br>Hear then and know it for yourself.',
'6:1': 'Then Job [1]answered and said,',
'6:2': 'Oh that my [1]vexation were weighed indeed,<br>And that my ruin were lifted onto the scales together with it!',
'6:3': 'For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;<br>Therefore my words have been rash.',
'6:4': 'For the arrows of the Almighty are in me,<br>The poison of which my spirit drinks up;<br>The terrors of God are arrayed against me.',
'6:5': 'Does the wild ass bray over its grass?<br>Or does the ox low over its fodder?',
'6:6': 'Is what is savorless eaten without salt?<br>Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?',
'6:7': 'My soul refuses to touch them;<br>They are like putrid food to me.',
'6:8': 'Oh that I might have my request,<br>And that God would grant me what I long for;',
'6:9': 'That God would be willing to crush me;<br>That He would release His hand and cut me off!',
'6:10': 'Then there would still be comfort for me;<br>And I would exult, even in writhing pain that does not spare,<br>That I did not [1]deny the words of the [a]Holy One.',
'6:11': 'What is my strength, that I should wait?<br>And what is my end, that I should be patient?',
'6:12': 'Is my strength the strength of stones?<br>Or is my flesh bronze?',
'6:13': 'Is there any help for me at all within me,<br>And has wisdom been driven away from me?',
'6:14': 'To him who is fainting there should be kindness from his friend,<br>Else he will forsake the fear of the Almighty.',
'6:15': 'My brothers have dealt as treacherously as a desert [a]brook,<br>As the rivulets of the desert brooks that pass away,',
'6:16': 'Which are turbid because of the ice,<br>And into which the snow hides itself.',
'6:17': 'When they are scorched, they are completely consumed;<br>When it is hot, they are dried up from their place.',
'6:18': 'Caravans divert their ways for them;<br>They go up into the waste and perish.',
'6:19': 'The caravans of Tema look for them;<br>The companies of Sheba long for them.',
'6:20': 'They are put to shame because they are confident;<br>They go there and are confounded.',
'6:21': 'So now you have become such;<br>You see a terrible thing and are afraid.',
'6:22': 'Have I said, Give me something?<br>Or, Pay a bribe for me out of your wealth?',
'6:23': 'Or, Deliver me from the hand of the adversary?<br>Or, From the hand of the oppressors redeem me?',
'6:24': 'Teach me, and I will be silent;<br>Cause me to understand how I have erred.',
'6:25': 'How forceful are upright words!<br>But what does this reproving from you reprove?',
'6:26': 'Do you think you can reprove words?<br>But the words of a desperate man are for the wind.',
'6:27': 'You would even cast lots over the orphan<br>And bargain over your friend.',
'6:28': 'Now then be pleased to look upon me,<br>For surely I will not lie to your face.',
'6:29': 'Turn now; let there be no injustice.<br>Indeed turn; my righteousness is still here.',
'6:30': 'Is there any injustice on my tongue?<br>Can my palate not discern calamities?',
'7:1': 'Does not man have a term of hard service on earth?<br>And are his [a]days not like the days of a hired hand?',
'7:2': 'Like a servant who longs for the shade,<br>And like a hired hand who waits for his pay,',
'7:3': 'So I am made to inherit months of vanity,<br>And nights of trouble are appointed to me.',
'7:4': 'If I lie down, I say,<br>When will I arise? But the evening is long,<br>And I am full of tossings until the dawn.',
'7:5': 'My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt clods;<br>My skin crusts and then oozes again.',
'7:6': 'My [a]days are swifter than a weaver&rsquo;s shuttle<br>And are spent [1]without hope.',
'7:7': 'Remember that my life is a [a]breath;<br>My eye will not see good again.',
'7:8': 'The eye of him who sees me will not look on me;<br>Your eyes will be on me, but I will not be.',
'7:9': 'The cloud is consumed and [a]goes away:<br>Likewise he who goes down into [b]Sheol does not come up.',
'7:10': 'He [a]returns no more to his house,<br>Nor does his place know him anymore.',
'7:11': 'For my part, I also will not restrain my mouth;<br>I will speak in the distress of my spirit;<br>I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.',
'7:12': 'Am I the sea, or a sea serpent,<br>That You must set a watch over me?',
'7:13': 'When I say, My bed will comfort me,<br>My couch will bear up my complaint;',
'7:14': 'Then You scare me with dreams<br>And terrify me with visions,',
'7:15': 'So that my soul would choose strangulation<br>And death rather than my bones.',
'7:16': 'I [1]loathe life; I would not live forever.<br>Leave me alone, for my days are a mere breath.',
'7:17': '[a]What is [b]mortal man that You magnify him,<br>And that You consider him,',
'7:18': 'And that You visit him every morning,<br>You try him every moment?',
'7:19': 'How long before You look away from me,<br>Before You abandon me until I swallow my spittle?',
'7:20': 'If I have sinned, what have I done to You, O Watcher of man?<br>Why have You made me Your target so that I have become a burden to You?',
'7:21': 'And why do You not forgive my transgression<br>And take away my iniquity?<br>For now I may lie down in the [a]dust;<br>And You will seek me out, and I will not be.',
'8:1': 'Then Bildad the Shuhite [1]answered and said,',
'8:2': 'How long will you speak these things?<br>And how long will the words of your mouth be like a mighty wind?',
'8:3': 'Does God pervert [a]justice?<br>Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?',
'8:4': 'If your [a]children have sinned against Him,<br>He has delivered them into the hand of their transgression.',
'8:5': 'If you seek earnestly after God<br>And make supplication unto the Almighty,',
'8:6': 'If you are pure and upright,<br>Then surely He will rouse Himself for you<br>And restore well-being to your righteous habitation.',
'8:7': 'And though your beginning was small,<br>Your end will be very great.',
'8:8': 'For inquire now of the former generation,<br>And attend to what their fathers have sought out.',
'8:9': 'For we are of yesterday and know nothing,<br>Because our days upon the earth are a [a]shadow.',
'8:10': 'Will they not teach you and talk to you<br>And utter forth words from their heart?',
'8:11': 'Can papyrus shoot up without marsh?<br>Can reeds grow without water?',
'8:12': 'While it is still in its greenness and not cut down,<br>It [a]withers before all other grasses.',
'8:13': 'So are the paths of all who forget God;<br>And the hope of the profane perishes,',
'8:14': 'Whose confidence is cut off,<br>And whose trust is a spider&rsquo;s web.',
'8:15': 'He leans upon his house, but it will not stand;<br>He holds fast to it, but it will not endure.',
'8:16': 'He is full of sap before the sun,<br>And his shoots go forth over his garden.',
'8:17': 'His roots are entwined around a stone heap;<br>He looks upon a place of stones.',
'8:18': 'If [1]one destroys him from his place,<br>Then it denies him, saying, I have not seen you.',
'8:19': 'Indeed, that is the joy of his way;<br>And others spring forth out of the dust.',
'8:20': 'Indeed, God will not reject a perfect man,<br>Nor will He support evildoers.',
'8:21': 'He will yet fill your mouth with laughter<br>And your lips with shouting.',
'8:22': 'Those who hate you will be clothed with shame,<br>And the tent of the wicked will be no more.',
'9:1': 'Then Job answered and said,',
'9:2': 'I do indeed know that it is so.<br>But how can a man be [a]righteous before God?',
'9:3': 'If he is pleased to contend with Him,<br>He cannot answer Him one thing in a thousand.',
'9:4': 'He is wise in heart and mighty in strength&mdash;<br>Who has ever resisted Him and come through whole?&mdash;',
'9:5': 'He who [1a]removes mountains, and they do not know it,<br>When He overturns them in His anger;',
'9:6': 'Who [a]shakes the earth from its place,<br>And its pillars shake;',
'9:7': 'Who commands the [a]sun, and it does not rise,<br>And seals up the stars;',
'9:8': 'Who alone [a]stretched forth the heavens<br>And [b]trod upon the heights of the sea;',
'9:9': 'Who made the [a]Bear, [b]Orion, and the Pleiades,<br>And the chambers of the south;',
'9:10': 'Who does great things that cannot be searched,<br>Indeed, wonderful deeds that cannot be numbered.',
'9:11': 'Indeed, He passes by me, but I do not see Him;<br>And He goes by, but I do not perceive Him.',
'9:12': 'Indeed, He snatches away; who can stop Him?<br>Who can say to Him, [a]What are You doing?',
'9:13': 'God does not turn back His anger;<br>Under Him [1]Rahab&rsquo;s helpers stoop.',
'9:14': 'How then can I answer Him<br>And choose my words properly with Him?',
'9:15': 'I, though righteous, could not answer Him;<br>I could only plead for mercy before my [1]Judge.',
'9:16': 'If I called out and He answered me,<br>I do not believe that He would hearken to my voice.',
'9:17': 'For He crushes me with a whirlwind<br>And multiplies my wounds without cause.',
'9:18': 'He does not permit me to catch my breath,<br>But fills me with bitterness.',
'9:19': 'If we speak of strength, indeed, He is mighty!<br>Or if of [a]judgment, Who, says He, can appoint Me a time?',
'9:20': 'Though I am righteous, my mouth would condemn me;<br>Though I am perfect, [1]it would prove me perverse.',
'9:21': 'I am [a]perfect; I do not regard my soul;<br>I despise my life.',
'9:22': 'It is all one; therefore I say,<br>He destroys the perfect and the wicked.',
'9:23': 'If some scourge suddenly kills,<br>He derides the [1]despair of the innocent.',
'9:24': 'The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;<br>He covers the faces of its judges.<br>If not He, then who is it?',
'9:25': 'And my [a]days are swifter than a running messenger;<br>They flee away, they do not see good;',
'9:26': 'They go by like reed boats,<br>Like an eagle swooping on the prey.',
'9:27': 'If I say, I will forget my complaint,<br>I will put off my sad countenance and look cheerful;',
'9:28': 'I fear all my pains:<br>I know that You will not hold me innocent.',
'9:29': 'I will be accounted wicked;<br>Why then do I labor in vain?',
'9:30': 'If I [a]wash myself with [1]soap<br>And cleanse my hands with lye,',
'9:31': 'Yet You will plunge me into the pit,<br>And my own garments will abhor me.',
'9:32': 'For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him,<br>That we should enter into litigation together.',
'9:33': 'There is no referee between us,<br>Who may lay his hand upon us both.',
'9:34': 'Let Him take His rod away from me,<br>And let not the dread of Him terrify me;',
'9:35': 'Then I would speak and not be afraid;<br>For I am not such.',
'10:1': 'My soul loathes my own [a]life;<br>I will let my complaint have free course in me;<br>I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.',
'10:2': 'I will say to God, Do not account me wicked;<br>Make known to me why You [a]contend with me.',
'10:3': 'Does it seem good to You to oppress,<br>To despise the toil of Your hands<br>And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?',
'10:4': 'Do You have eyes of flesh?<br>Or do You see as a man sees?',
'10:5': 'Are Your days like the days of a man,<br>Or Your years like the days of a mighty man,',
'10:6': 'That You would seek out my iniquity<br>And search for my sin,',
'10:7': 'Even though You know that I am not wicked<br>[a]And that there is none who can deliver out of Your hand?',
'10:8': 'Your hands have [a]shaped me and made me altogether,<br>Yet You destroy me.',
'10:9': 'Remember now that You have made me like [a]clay;<br>And will You return me to the [b]dust?',
'10:10': 'Have You not poured me out like milk<br>And curdled me like cheese?',
'10:11': 'You have clothed me with skin and flesh<br>And [a]woven me together with bones and sinews.',
'10:12': 'You have granted me life and lovingkindness,<br>And Your visitation has preserved my spirit.',
'10:13': 'But You have [1a]hidden these things in Your heart;<br>I know that this is with You:',
'10:14': 'If I sin, You mark me,<br>And You do not acquit me of my iniquity;',
'10:15': 'If I am wicked, woe unto me;<br>If I am righteous, I [a]cannot lift up my head,<br>Being filled with dishonor and looking on my affliction.',
'10:16': 'And if [1]my head should be lifted up, You would hunt me down like a lion,<br>And You would again demonstrate wonders on me.',
'10:17': 'You renew Your witnesses against me<br>And increase Your anger against me;<br>Attacking waves and a host are against me.',
'10:18': 'And why have You brought me out of the [a]womb?<br>I should have died that no eye had seen me;',
'10:19': 'I should have been as though I had not been;<br>I should have been carried from birth to the grave.',
'10:20': 'Are not my days few? Cease then,<br>And let me alone, that I may be somewhat [1]revived,',
'10:21': 'Before I go, and never [a]return,<br>To the land of darkness and the shadow of death,',
'10:22': 'The land of gloom like deep darkness,<br>The [a]shadow of death without order,<br>Which shines like deep darkness.',
'11:1': 'Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,',
'11:2': 'Should a multitude of words not be answered?<br>And should a man of much talk be justified?',
'11:3': 'Shall your empty talk silence men?<br>And will you mock, and there be none to shame you?',
'11:4': 'For you say, My doctrine is pure,<br>And I am clean in Your eyes.',
'11:5': 'But, oh, that God would speak<br>And open His lips to you,',
'11:6': 'And that He would tell you the secrets of wisdom!<br>For there are two sides to sound reason.<br>Know then that God has forgotten some of your iniquity.',
'11:7': 'Can you find out the [1a]depths of God?<br>Can you find out the [b]limit of the Almighty?',
'11:8': 'It is the height of heaven&mdash;what can you do?<br>It is deeper than Sheol&mdash;what can you know?',
'11:9': 'Its measure is longer than that of the earth<br>And broader than the sea.',
'11:10': 'If He passes by and imprisons<br>And summons an assembly, who can stop Him?',
'11:11': 'For He knows men of falsehood,<br>And He sees iniquity without considering it.',
'11:12': 'But an [1]empty-headed man acquires intelligence<br>When the [1]foal of a wild ass is born as a man.',
'11:13': 'If you would set your heart right<br>And stretch your hands out to Him&mdash;',
'11:14': 'If there is iniquity in your hand, put it far away,<br>And do not let wrong dwell in your tents&mdash;',
'11:15': 'Then indeed you would lift up your face without blemish,<br>And you would be [a]steadfast and would not be afraid.',
'11:16': 'For you will forget your misery;<br>You will remember it as waters that have passed away.',
'11:17': 'And your time here will rise more brightly than the noonday;<br>Dark though it may be, it will be like the morning.',
'11:18': 'And you will be secure, for there is hope;<br>And you will search about and lie down in security.',
'11:19': 'Indeed you will lie down, and there will be none to terrify you;<br>And many will entreat your favor.',
'11:20': 'But the eyes of the wicked will fail,<br>And fleeing will be lost to them,<br>And their hope will be to breathe out their life.',
'12:1': 'Then Job answered and said,',
'12:2': 'Surely then you are the people,<br>And wisdom will die with you.',
'12:3': 'I also have understanding as you do;<br>I am not inferior to you.<br>And who does not know things like these?',
'12:4': 'I have become a laughingstock to [1]my friends,<br>I, who have called out to God and He answers [2]me.<br>The righteous man, the perfect man, is a [a]laughingstock.',
'12:5': 'There is contempt for calamity in the thought of him who is at ease:<br>It is prepared for those whose foot slips.',
'12:6': 'The tents of robbers prosper,<br>And those who provoke God have security,<br>Those who carry their god in their own [1]might.',
'12:7': 'But ask now of the beasts, and they will [a]teach you;<br>And of the birds of heaven, and they will tell you.',
'12:8': 'Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you;<br>And the fish of the sea will declare to you.',
'12:9': 'Who among all these does not know<br>That the hand of Jehovah has done this,',
'12:10': 'In whose hand is the [1a]life of every living thing<br>And the [1]breath of all flesh of man?',
'12:11': 'Does not the ear [a]try words<br>Even as the palate tastes food for itself?',
'12:12': 'In aged men, you say, there is wisdom,<br>And in length of days there is understanding.',
'12:13': 'But with Him are [a]wisdom and might;<br>Counsel and understanding are His.',
'12:14': 'Indeed, He breaks down, and it cannot be rebuilt;<br>He shuts a man up, and the door cannot be opened.',
'12:15': 'Indeed, He withholds the [a]waters, and they dry up;<br>And He [b]sends them forth, and they overturn the earth.',
'12:16': 'With Him are strength and effectual wisdom;<br>The deceived and the deceiver are His.',
'12:17': 'He leads [a]counselors away stripped,<br>And He makes fools of judges.',
'12:18': 'He loosens the fetters of kings<br>And binds their loins with a belt.',
'12:19': 'He leads priests away stripped,<br>And He overturns dignitaries.',
'12:20': 'He removes the utterance of the trusty<br>And takes away the counsel of the elders.',
'12:21': 'He pours contempt upon the princes<br>And loosens the belt of the strong.',
'12:22': 'He uncovers the depths out of darkness<br>And [a]brings to light the shadow of death.',
'12:23': 'He makes nations great and destroys them;<br>He expands nations and leads them off.',
'12:24': 'He removes the understanding of the heads of the people of the earth<br>And causes them to wander in a pathless waste.',
'12:25': 'They grope in darkness, and there is no light;<br>And He causes them to stagger like a drunken man.',
'13:1': 'Indeed, my eye has seen all this;<br>My ear has heard and understood it.',
'13:2': 'What you know, I also know;<br>I am not inferior to you.',
'13:3': 'But I would speak to the Almighty,<br>And I desire to [a]argue with God.',
'13:4': 'Yet you are plasterers of lies;<br>[a]Physicians of no value are you all.',
'13:5': 'Oh that you would be altogether silent,<br>And this would be your wisdom!',
'13:6': 'Hear now my argument,<br>And hearken to the contentions of my lips.',
'13:7': 'Will you speak wrongly for God<br>And speak deceitfully for Him?',
'13:8': 'Will you be partial to Him?<br>Will you contend for God?',
'13:9': 'Will it be well with you when He searches you out?<br>Or will you [a]deceive Him as one might deceive a man?',
'13:10': 'He will surely reprove you<br>If you are secretly partial.',
'13:11': 'Will not His majesty make you afraid<br>And His dread fall on you?',
'13:12': 'Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes;<br>Your defenses are defenses of clay.',
'13:13': 'Be silent before me, and I myself will speak;<br>And let come on me what may.',
'13:14': '[1]I will take my flesh in my teeth<br>And put my life in my hand.',
'13:15': 'Indeed, He will kill me; I have no hope.<br>Nevertheless I will argue my ways before Him.',
'13:16': 'This also will be my salvation,<br>That no profane man may come before Him.',
'13:17': 'Hear carefully my words,<br>And let my declaration be in your ears.',
'13:18': 'Here now, I have [a]arranged my case;<br>I know that I will be vindicated.',
'13:19': 'Who will contend with me?<br>For then I would be silent and die.',
'13:20': 'Only do not do two things to me,<br>Then I will not hide from Your face:',
'13:21': 'Withdraw Your hand far from me,<br>And do not let Your terror frighten me.',
'13:22': 'Then call, and I will answer;<br>Or let me speak, and You respond to me.',
'13:23': 'How many are my iniquities and sins?<br>Make my transgression and my sin [a]known to me.',
'13:24': 'Why do You [a]hide Your face<br>And consider me as Your [b]enemy?',
'13:25': 'Will You harass a driven leaf<br>And pursue dry chaff?',
'13:26': 'For You write bitter things against me<br>And cause me to inherit the iniquities of my youth;',
'13:27': 'And You put my feet in [a]stocks<br>And mark all my paths;<br>You set a limit for the soles of my feet.',
'13:28': 'And such a one is like some rotten thing that wastes away,<br>Like a garment eaten by [a]moths.',
'14:1': 'Man, born of woman,<br>Is of [a]few days and full of trouble.',
'14:2': 'He comes forth like a [a]blossom and [1]is cut down,<br>He also flees like a shadow and does not remain.',
'14:3': 'And do You open Your eyes upon such a one<br>And bring me into [a]litigation with You?',
'14:4': 'Who can bring a clean thing out from the unclean?<br>No one!',
'14:5': 'Since his days are [a]determined,<br>And the number of his months is with You;<br>Since You have appointed his bounds, and he cannot go beyond;',
'14:6': 'Look away from him that he may rest,<br>Until he fulfills his day like a hired hand.',
'14:7': 'For there is hope for a tree:<br>If it is cut down, it will [a]sprout again,<br>And its tender shoot will not cease.',
'14:8': 'Though its root grows old in the earth,<br>And its trunk dies in the dirt,',
'14:9': 'At the scent of water it will bud<br>And will produce branches like a new plant.',
'14:10': 'But a man dies and is laid low;<br>Yes, a man expires, and then [a]where is he?',
'14:11': 'The waters of the sea recede,<br>And the river becomes parched and dried up:',
'14:12': 'So a man lies down and does not rise up;<br>Until the [a]heavens are no more, [1]he will not awake,<br>Nor will [1]he be roused from [2]his sleep.',
'14:13': 'Oh, that You would hide me in Sheol,<br>That You would conceal me until Your anger has passed,<br>That You would set me an appointed time and remember me!',
'14:14': 'If a man dies, will he live again?<br>All the days of my service I would wait,<br>Until a change for me should come.',
'14:15': 'You would call, and I would answer You;<br>You would long after the work of Your hands.',
'14:16': 'For now You number my steps.<br>Do You not watch over my sin?',
'14:17': 'My transgression has been sealed up in a bag,<br>And You have fastened up my iniquity.',
'14:18': 'However the mountain falls and crumbles,<br>And the rock moves from its place;',
'14:19': 'Waters wear away stones;<br>Their torrents wash away the dust of the earth:<br>So You destroy the hope of man.',
'14:20': 'You prevail forever against him, and he passes away;<br>You change his countenance and send him away.',
'14:21': 'His sons gain honor, but he does not know it;<br>And they become insignificant, but he does not perceive it.',
'14:22': 'Only the pain of his own flesh does he feel,<br>And his own soul mourns for him.',
'15:1': 'And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,',
'15:2': 'Should a wise man answer with the knowledge of wind,<br>And should he fill his belly with the east wind?',
'15:3': 'Should he argue with useless talk<br>And with words by which he cannot avail?',
'15:4': 'Indeed you do away with the fear of God<br>And restrain meditation before God.',
'15:5': 'For your iniquity instructs your mouth,<br>And you choose the tongue of the crafty.',
'15:6': 'Your own mouth condemns you, and not I;<br>And your own lips testify against you.',
'15:7': 'Are you the first man born?<br>Or were you brought forth before the hills?',
'15:8': 'Did you listen in on the [a]secret council of God?<br>And do you limit wisdom to yourself?',
'15:9': 'What do you know that we do not know?<br>What do you understand that is not with us?',
'15:10': 'Both the grayheaded and the aged are among us,<br>Older than your father.',
'15:11': 'Are the consolations of God too small for you,<br>Or the word spoken gently to you?',
'15:12': 'Why does your heart take you away?<br>And why do your eyes flash,',
'15:13': 'That you turn your spirit against God<br>And let words go forth from your mouth?',
'15:14': 'What is mortal man, that he can be [a]clean,<br>Or he who is [b]born of a woman, that he can be [c]righteous?',
'15:15': 'Indeed, He puts no trust in His holy ones;<br>Even the [a]heavens are not clean in His eyes.',
'15:16': 'How much less one who is abominable and corrupt!<br>How much less a man who drinks wrong like water!',
'15:17': '[1]I will tell you; hear me;<br>And what I have seen, that will I recount,',
'15:18': 'What wise men have declared,<br>And have not hidden, from their fathers;',
'15:19': 'To whom alone the land was given,<br>And no stranger passed in their midst:',
'15:20': 'For all his days the wicked man travails in pain,<br>And numbered years are stored up for the ruthless man.',
'15:21': 'The sound of terrors is in his ears;<br>While he is at peace, the destroyer will come upon him.',
'15:22': 'He does not believe that he will return from the darkness,<br>And he is spied out for the sword.',
'15:23': 'He wanders for bread&mdash;where is it?<br>He knows that the day of darkness is ready at hand.',
'15:24': 'Distress and straits terrify him;<br>They prevail against him, like a king prepared for the attack;',
'15:25': 'Because he stretched out his hand against God,<br>And against the Almighty he acted mightily,',
'15:26': 'Running against Him with a stiff neck,<br>With the thick bosses of his shield;',
'15:27': 'Because he covered his face with his fatness<br>And gathered fat upon his loins;',
'15:28': 'And he dwelt in desolated cities,<br>In houses which should not have been inhabited,<br>Which were appointed to become heaps.',
'15:29': 'He will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure;<br>Nor will [1]his produce bend down to the earth.',
'15:30': 'He will not go away from darkness;<br>The flame will dry up his shoots,<br>And by the breath of His mouth he will go away.',
'15:31': 'Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself;<br>For vanity will be his recompense.',
'15:32': 'It will be fully paid before his day,<br>And his branch will not be flourishing.',
'15:33': 'He will shake off his unripe grapes like a vine,<br>And he will cast off his blossom like an olive tree.',
'15:34': 'For the company of the profane will be barren,<br>And fire will devour the tents of bribery.',
'15:35': 'They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity,<br>And their heart prepares deceit.',
'16:1': 'Then Job answered and said,',
'16:2': 'I have heard many such things;<br>Troubling [a]comforters are you all.',
'16:3': 'Do words of wind have an end?<br>Or what has provoked you that you so respond?',
'16:4': 'I also could speak like you,<br>If your soul were in my soul&rsquo;s stead;<br>I could join my words together against you<br>And shake my head at you.',
'16:5': 'I could strengthen you with my mouth,<br>And the movement of my lips would mitigate your pain.',
'16:6': 'If I speak, my pain is not mitigated;<br>And if I forbear, how much departs from me?',
'16:7': 'But now He has worn me out;<br>You have desolated all my company.',
'16:8': 'And You have seized me; it is a testimony against me;<br>And my leanness rises up against me; it testifies to my face.',
'16:9': 'In His wrath He has torn me to pieces and been adverse toward me;<br>He has [a]gnashed His teeth at me.<br>My [b]Adversary sharpens His eyes at me.',
'16:10': 'With their mouth they gape at me;<br>They strike my cheek reproachfully;<br>They mass themselves together against me.',
'16:11': 'God has delivered me over to the unjust<br>And cast me down into the hands of the wicked.',
'16:12': 'I was at ease, and He broke me apart;<br>Indeed He took me by my neck and dashed me to pieces.<br>And He set me up as His [a]target;',
'16:13': 'His archers surrounded me;<br>He split open my kidneys and did not desist;<br>He poured out my gall upon the earth.',
'16:14': 'He broke me open with breach upon breach;<br>He ran at me like a mighty man of war.',
'16:15': 'I have sewn sackcloth upon my skin<br>And have cast my horn into the dust.',
'16:16': 'My face is reddened with weeping,<br>And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;',
'16:17': 'Though there is no violence in my hands,<br>And my prayer is pure.',
'16:18': 'O earth, do not cover my [a]blood;<br>And let there be no resting place for my crying out.',
'16:19': 'Even now, there in heaven is my [a]Witness,<br>And He who vouches for me is in the heights.',
'16:20': 'My friends deride me;<br>My eye pours out tears to God,',
'16:21': 'That He would plead for a man in his case with God<br>And for a son of man in his case with his neighbor.',
'16:22': 'For when years few in number have come,<br>I will go the way from which I cannot return.',
'17:1': 'My spirit is [a]broken;<br>My days are extinct;<br>The graveyard is ready for me.',
'17:2': 'Surely there are mockers with me,<br>And my eye lingers on their provocation.',
'17:3': 'Lay down now a pledge for me with Yourself;<br>Who is he who will [1]strike hands with me?',
'17:4': 'For You have hidden their heart from insight;<br>Therefore You will not exalt them.',
'17:5': 'He who denounces his friends for a share of the profit taken,<br>Even the eyes of his children will fail.',
'17:6': 'But He has made me a [a]byword of the people,<br>And I have become one on whom they may spit.',
'17:7': 'And my eye has grown dim because of the sorrow,<br>And my members are all like a shadow.',
'17:8': 'The upright are appalled at this,<br>And the innocent stir themselves up against the profane man.',
'17:9': 'Yet the righteous man will hold fast to his way,<br>And he whose [a]hands are clean will wax yet stronger.',
'17:10': 'But all of you, come back now,<br>And I will not find a wise man among you.',
'17:11': 'My days have passed; broken are my plans,<br>The cherished thoughts of my heart.',
'17:12': 'They change night into day;<br>The light is near, they say in the face of darkness.',
'17:13': 'If I wait for [a]Sheol as my house;<br>If I spread my couch in the darkness;',
'17:14': 'If I call out to the pit, You are my father;<br>You are my mother and my sister, to the worm;',
'17:15': 'Where then is my hope?<br>Indeed, my hope, who will see it?',
'17:16': 'It will go down to the bars of Sheol,<br>When, at the same time, we have rest in the [a]dust.',
'18:1': 'Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,',
'18:2': 'How long will you hunt for words?<br>Consider, and afterward we will speak.',
'18:3': 'Why are we considered to be like beasts<br>And have become unclean in your eyes?',
'18:4': 'You who tear yourself in your anger,<br>Will the earth be forsaken for your sake,<br>Or will the rock be removed from its place?',
'18:5': 'Indeed the light of the wicked goes out,<br>And the flame of his fire does not shine.',
'18:6': 'The light is darkness in his tent,<br>And his lamp above him goes out.',
'18:7': 'The steps of his strength are confined,<br>And his counsel has cast him down.',
'18:8': 'For he has been cast into a net by his own feet,<br>And he walks about on the webbing of a pitfall.',
'18:9': 'A snare grabs him by the heel;<br>A trap lays hold on him.',
'18:10': 'A rope is hidden for him on the ground,<br>And a trap for him, on the path.',
'18:11': 'Terrors frighten him all around<br>And chase him at his heels.',
'18:12': 'His strength is famished,<br>And calamity is prepared at his side.',
'18:13': 'It devours the members of his body;<br>The firstborn of death devours his members.',
'18:14': 'He is rooted out of his tent, in which he trusts;<br>And he is made to march to the king of terrors.',
'18:15': 'That which is not his dwells in his tent;<br>Brimstone is scattered upon his habitation.',
'18:16': 'Beneath, his roots are dried up;<br>And above, his branch is withered.',
'18:17': 'The memory of him perishes from the earth,<br>And he has no name on the open plain.',
'18:18': 'He is thrust out from the light to the darkness<br>And driven from the world.',
'18:19': 'He has [a]no posterity and no progeny among his people,<br>And there are none remaining where he sojourned.',
'18:20': 'Those who come after will be astonished at his day,<br>As those who went before were horrified.',
'18:21': 'Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust,<br>And this is the place of him who does not [a]know God.',
'19:1': 'Then Job answered and said,',
'19:2': 'How long will you grieve my soul<br>And crush me with your words?',
'19:3': 'These [a]ten times you have reproached me;<br>You are not ashamed to deal wrongly with me.',
'19:4': 'And be it that I have erred,<br>My error remains with me.',
'19:5': 'If you indeed magnify yourselves against me<br>And use my reproach in argument against me,',
'19:6': 'Know then that God has [1]subverted my cause<br>And compassed me about with His net.',
'19:7': 'Indeed, I cry out, Violence! and I am not answered;<br>I call for help, and there is no justice.',
'19:8': 'He has [a]walled up my way so that I cannot pass;<br>And He has put darkness upon my paths.',
'19:9': 'He has stripped my [1]glory from me<br>And taken away the [1]crown on my head.',
'19:10': 'He has broken me all around, and I am gone;<br>And my [1]hope is plucked up like a tree.',
'19:11': 'He has also kindled His [1]anger against me,<br>And in Himself He considers me as His [1a]adversary.',
'19:12': 'His troops come together<br>And cast up their highway against me<br>And encamp all around my tent.',
'19:13': 'He has removed my brothers far from me,<br>And those who know me are wholly estranged from me.',

'19:18': 'Even little children despise me:<br>I arise and they speak against me.',
'19:19': 'All the men whom I take counsel with abhor me,<br>And those whom I love have turned against me.',
'19:20': 'My [a]bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh,<br>And I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.',
'19:21': 'Pity me, pity me, O my friends;<br>For the [a]hand of God has touched me.',
'19:22': 'Why do you persecute me as God does<br>And are not satisfied with eating my flesh?',
'19:23': 'Oh, that my words were now written!<br>Oh, that they were inscribed in a [a]book!',
'19:24': 'That with an [a]iron pen and with lead<br>They were engraved in rock forever!',
'19:25': 'But I know that my [1a]Redeemer lives,<br>And at the last He will stand upon the earth;',

'19:28': 'If you say, How will we persecute him?<br>For the root of the matter is found in him;',
'19:29': 'Be fearful of the sword,<br>For wrath brings the punishment of the sword,<br>That you may know that there is a judgment.',
'20:1': 'Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,',

'20:25': 'He draws the arrow out, and it comes out of his body;<br>Indeed the glittering point goes forth from his gall.<br>Terrors come upon him.',
'20:26': 'Total darkness is laid up as his treasures;<br>A fire not fanned by man will devour him;<br>It will feed on what is left in his tent.',
'20:27': 'The heavens will reveal his iniquity,<br>And the earth will rise up against him.',
'20:28': 'The increase of his house will depart<br>As things swept away in the [a]day of His wrath.',
'20:29': 'This is the wicked man&rsquo;s portion from God<br>And the inheritance decreed to him by God.',
'21:1': 'Then Job answered and said,',
'21:2': 'Listen carefully to my word,<br>And let this be your consolations.',
'21:3': 'Bear with me, and I will speak;<br>And after I have spoken, mock on.',
'21:4': 'As for me, is my complaint to man?<br>And why should my spirit not be impatient?',
'21:5': 'Look at me and be appalled;<br>And put your hand over your mouth.',
'21:6': 'Even when I remember, I am troubled,<br>And horror takes hold of my flesh.',
'21:7': 'Why do the [a]wicked live,<br>Grow old, even become mighty in riches?',
'21:8': 'Their seed is established with them in their sight,<br>And their offspring, before their eyes.',
'21:9': 'Their houses are free from dread,<br>And the [a]rod of God is not upon them.',

'21:12': 'They lift up their voices to the tambourine and lyre,<br>And they rejoice at the sound of the flute.',
'21:13': 'They spend their days in prosperity,<br>And in a moment they go down into [a]Sheol.',
'21:14': 'And they say unto God, [a]Depart from us,<br>For we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.',
'21:15': '[a]What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?<br>And what profit is there, that we should pray to Him?',
'21:16': 'Indeed, their prosperity is not in their own hand.<br>The counsel of the wicked is far from [1]Him.',
'21:17': 'How often is the lamp of the wicked put out,<br>So that their calamity comes upon them,<br>So that [1]God distributes sorrows in His anger?',
'21:18': 'Do they become like straw before the wind<br>And like chaff that the storm carries off?',
'21:19': 'You say, God stores up the punishment of his iniquity for his children.<br>I say, Let Him recompense him, so that he knows it.',
'21:20': 'Let his eyes see his destruction,<br>And let him drink the wrath of the Almighty.',
'21:21': 'For what is there for him to delight in, in his house after him,<br>When the number of his months is cut off?',
'21:22': 'Will someone teach knowledge to God,<br>Seeing that He judges those who are on high?',
'21:23': 'One dies in his full strength,<br>Being completely at ease and quiet;',

'21:34': 'Why then do you comfort me with vanity?<br>For your responses leave only falsehood behind.',
'22:1': 'And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,',

'22:3': 'Is it a matter of delight to the Almighty that you are righteous?<br>Or is it a gain to Him that you make your ways perfect?',
'22:4': 'Is it because of your fear of Him that He reproves you,<br>That He enters into judgment with you?',
'22:5': 'Is not your wickedness great,<br>And is there no end to your iniquities?',
'22:6': 'For you have taken [a]pledges from your brothers without cause<br>And stripped the naked of their clothing.',

'22:8': 'And as for the man of power, the earth was his;<br>And the man of honor dwelt in it.',
'22:9': 'You have sent away the widows empty,<br>And the arms of the orphans have been crushed.',

'22:16': 'Such were snatched away before their time,<br>Whose foundation was poured forth like a stream;',
'22:17': 'Who said to God, Depart from us;<br>And, What can the Almighty accomplish for [1]us?',
'22:18': 'Yet He fills their houses with good things.<br>But the counsel of the wicked is far from [1]Him.',
'22:19': 'The righteous see and rejoice,<br>And the innocent deride them,',
'22:20': 'Saying, Surely those who rose up against us are cut off,<br>And the remnant of them the fire has devoured.',
'22:21': '[1]Be well disposed to Him and at peace with Him;<br>By such, good will come upon you.',
'22:22': 'Receive instruction from His mouth,<br>And lay up His words in your [a]heart.',
'22:23': 'If you return to the [a]Almighty, you will be built up.<br>If you put injustice far away from your tents,',

'23:4': 'I would [a]present my cause in order before Him,<br>And I would fill my mouth with arguments.',
'23:5': 'I would know the words which He would answer me,<br>And I would understand what He would speak to me.',

'23:14': 'For He performs what has been appointed to me,<br>And many such things are with Him.',
'23:15': 'Therefore I am terrified at His presence;<br>I consider and am in dread of Him.',
'23:16': 'So God has made my heart faint,<br>And the Almighty has terrified me;',
'23:17': 'Because I was not cut off before the darkness,<br>Nor did He cover the deep darkness from my face.',
'24:1': 'Why are times of judgment not stored up by the Almighty?<br>And why do those who know Him not see His days?',
'24:2': 'Some remove [a]landmarks;<br>They seize the flock and pasture them.',
'24:3': 'They drive away the donkey of the fatherless<br>And take the widow&rsquo;s ox as a [a]pledge.',
'24:4': 'They turn the needy out of the way;<br>The poor of the land are made to hide together.',

'26:14': 'Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways;<br>And how small a whisper do we hear of Him!<br>But as for the thundering of His mightiness, who can comprehend it?',
'27:1': 'Then Job again took up his discourse and said,',

'31:15': 'Did not He who made me in the [a]womb make him?<br>And was it not One who fashioned us in the womb?',
'31:16': 'If I have withheld the poor from their desire,<br>Or have let the eyes of the widow fail,',
'31:17': 'Or have eaten my morsel alone<br>Without the orphan eating of it&mdash;',
'31:18': 'Rather, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,<br>And from my mother&rsquo;s womb I guided [1]the widow&mdash;',
'31:19': 'If I have seen someone perishing from [a]lack of clothing<br>Or that the needy had no covering;',
'31:20': 'If his loins have not blessed me,<br>And he has not been made warm with the fleece of my sheep;',
'31:21': 'If I have raised my hand against the orphan<br>Because I saw that I had support among those in the gate;',
'31:22': 'May my shoulder blade fall from the shoulder,<br>And may my arm be broken at the elbow.',
'31:23': 'For calamity from God is dreadful to me,<br>And because of His majesty I can do nothing.',
'31:24': 'If I have made gold my [a]hope,<br>And have called fine gold my confidence;',
'31:25': 'If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great<br>And because my hand had acquired much;',
'31:26': 'If I have looked at the sun when it shone<br>Or the moon going on in splendor,',
'31:27': 'And my heart has been secretly enticed,<br>And my mouth has kissed my hand;',
'31:28': 'It too would be wickedness, to be punished by the judges,<br>For I would have denied God above.',
'31:29': 'If I have rejoiced at the misfortune of him who hated me,<br>Or have exulted when evil found him&mdash;',
'31:30': 'Rather, I have not allowed my mouth to sin<br>By asking for his life with a curse&mdash;',
'31:31': 'If the men of my tent have not said,<br>Who can find one who has not been filled with [1]our master&rsquo;s meat?&mdash;',
'31:32': 'The sojourner has not lodged in the street;<br>I have opened my doors to the highway&mdash;',
'31:33': 'If I have [a]covered my transgressions [1]as [b]Adam did<br>By hiding my iniquity in my bosom,',
'31:34': 'Because I so dreaded the great multitude,<br>And the contempt of the families so frightened me,<br>That I was silent and did not go out my door&mdash;',
'31:35': 'Oh, that I had someone to hear me!<br>Here is my signature! Let the Almighty [a]answer me.<br>And let my accuser write up the charge.',
'31:36': 'Surely I would carry [1]it on my shoulder;<br>I would bind it onto me like a crown;',
'31:37': 'I would declare to Him the number of my steps;<br>Like a prince I would approach Him!',
'31:38': 'If my land cries out against me,<br>And its furrows weep together;',
'31:39': 'If I have eaten its strength without money,<br>And have caused its owners to lose their life;',
'31:40': 'May thorns come forth instead of wheat,<br>And pungent weeds instead of barley.<br>The words of Job are [1]ended.',
'32:1': 'Then these three men ceased answering Job, for he was [a]righteous in his own eyes.',
'32:2': 'And the [1]anger of [2]Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled. Against Job was his anger kindled because he [a]justified himself rather than God;',
'32:3': 'And against his three friends was his anger kindled because they had found no answer but had condemned Job.',
'32:4': 'Now Elihu had waited to speak with Job, because they were older than he.',
'32:5': 'But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, his anger was kindled.',
'32:6': 'So Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,<br>I am young,<br>And you are aged;<br>Therefore I shrank back and was afraid<br>To declare to you what I know.',
'32:7': 'I said, Let age speak,<br>And let the multitude of years make wisdom known.',
'32:8': 'But [1]there is a [2a]spirit in man,<br>And the [2b]breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.',
'32:9': 'It is not the great who are wise,<br>Nor the old who understand justice.',
'32:10': 'Therefore I say, Hear me;<br>I also will declare what I [1]know.',
'32:11': 'Indeed, I have waited out your words;<br>I have given ear to your reasonings,<br>While you searched for what to say.',
'32:12': 'Indeed I gave you my full attention;<br>But no one here could refute Job;<br>None of you answered his words.',
'32:13': 'Do not say, We have found wisdom;<br>God will defeat him, not man.',
'32:14': 'But he did not arrange his words against me;<br>Neither will I respond to him with your speeches.',
'32:15': 'They are dismayed; they answer no more;<br>Words fail them.',
'32:16': 'Then should I wait? For they do not speak,<br>For they stand still; they answer no more.',
'32:17': 'I also will answer what has been apportioned to me;<br>I also will declare what I know.',
'32:18': 'For I am full of words;<br>The spirit in my inward parts constrains me.',
'32:19': 'Indeed, my inward parts are like wine that is not vented;<br>Like [a]new wineskins, they are about to burst.',
'32:20': 'Let me speak, that there may be relief for me;<br>Let me open my lips and answer.',
'32:21': 'Let me not, I beg you, [a]respect any man&rsquo;s person,<br>Nor flatter any man;',
'32:22': 'For I do not know how to flatter&mdash;<br>My Maker would soon bear me off.',
'33:1': 'But now, Job, hear my speaking,<br>And give ear to all my words.',
'33:2': 'Indeed now, I have opened my mouth;<br>My tongue has spoken in my mouth.',
'33:3': 'My words manifest the uprightness of my heart,<br>And what my lips know they speak sincerely.',
'33:4': 'The Spirit of God has made me,<br>And the [a]breath of the Almighty has enlivened me.',
'33:5': 'If you can, respond to me;<br>Arrange your words before me; take your stand.',
'33:6': 'Indeed, I am before God as you are;<br>I too was cut out of [a]clay.',
'33:7': 'So no fear of me can terrify you,<br>Nor can my pressure be heavy upon you.',
'33:8': 'You have surely spoken in my hearing,<br>And I have heard the voice of your words, saying,',
'33:9': 'I am [a]clean and without transgression;<br>I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me.',
'33:10': 'See, He finds occasions for hostility against me;<br>He considers me as His [a]enemy.',
'33:11': 'He puts my feet in [a]stocks;<br>He watches all my paths.',
'33:12': 'However, in this you are not right, I will answer you,<br>For God is greater than man.',
'33:13': 'Why do you contend with Him,<br>Saying that He does not answer for any of His affairs?',
'33:14': 'For God speaks in one way,<br>Indeed in two ways, without any perceiving it&mdash;',
'33:15': 'In a [a]dream, a night vision,<br>When deep sleep falls upon men<br>In the slumberings upon their beds&mdash;',
'33:16': 'Then He opens the [a]ears of men<br>And seals up their instruction,',
'33:17': 'That He may turn man aside from his doing<br>And hide pride from man.',
'33:18': 'He keeps his soul from the pit,<br>And his life from perishing by the sword.',
'33:19': 'He is also chastened with pain upon his bed<br>And with continual strife in his bones,',
'33:20': 'So that his life abhors bread,<br>And his soul, fancy food.',
'33:21': 'His flesh is so consumed that it cannot be seen,<br>And his bones that had not been seen stick out.',
'33:22': 'And his soul draws near to the pit,<br>And his life, to the destroyers.',
'33:23': 'If there is with him an angel,<br>An interpreter, one of a thousand,<br>To declare to man what is right for him,',
'33:24': 'Then He will be gracious to him and will say,<br>Redeem him from going down into the pit;<br>I have found a ransom.',
'33:25': 'His flesh will be fresher than in childhood;<br>He will return to the days of his youth.',
'33:26': 'He will pray to God, and He will accept him,<br>So that he sees His face with joyous shouting;<br>And [1]God restores to man his righteousness.',
'33:27': 'He will sing to men and say,<br>I sinned and perverted what was right,<br>But it was not paid back to me.',
'33:28': 'He has [a]redeemed my soul from perishing in the pit,<br>And my life will see the light.',
'33:29': 'Indeed, all these things God accomplishes for a man,<br>Twice, even three times,',
'33:30': 'To bring his soul back from the pit,<br>To enlighten him with the [a]light of the living.',
'33:31': 'Take heed, Job; hear me.<br>Be silent, and I will speak.',
'33:32': 'If you have anything to say, answer me;<br>Speak, for I desire to justify you.',
'33:33': 'If not, you listen to me;<br>Be silent, and I will teach you wisdom.',
'34:1': 'Then Elihu continued and said,',
'34:2': 'Hear my words, you wise men;<br>And you who know, give ear to me.',
'34:3': 'For the [a]ear tries words<br>As the palate tastes food.',
'34:4': 'Let us choose for ourselves what is right;<br>Let us know among ourselves what is [a]good.',
'34:5': 'For Job has said, I am righteous,<br>And God has [1]taken away my [a]right;',
'34:6': 'Should I lie against my right?<br>My arrow wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.',
'34:7': 'What man is like Job,<br>Who drinks up scoffing like water,',
'34:8': 'Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity<br>And walks with wicked men?',
'34:9': 'For he has said, It does not [a]profit a man<br>To delight himself in God.',
'34:10': 'Therefore, you men of understanding, hear me:<br>Far be it from God that He would do evil,<br>And from the Almighty that He would commit iniquity.',
'34:11': 'For He will [a]render a man&rsquo;s work to him<br>And will cause a man to find that which is according to his own way.',
'34:12': 'Indeed in all certainty God will not do evil,<br>And the Almighty will not pervert justice.',
'34:13': 'Who has ever put the [a]earth in His charge?<br>Or who has ever set in order the whole world?',
'34:14': 'If He were to consider Himself only,<br>He would gather back to Himself His [a]spirit and His breath;',
'34:15': 'All flesh would perish together,<br>And man would return to [a]dust.',
'34:16': 'If then you have understanding, hear this;<br>Give ear to the voice of my words.',
'34:17': 'Shall one who hates justice govern?<br>And will you condemn the just and mighty One,',
'34:18': 'He who says to a king, You worthless one!<br>And to nobles, You wicked one!',
'34:19': 'He who does not [a]respect the persons of princes,<br>Nor regard the rich man more than the poor,<br>For they are all the work of His hands?',
'34:20': 'In a moment they die, and in the middle of the night<br>The people are shaken, and they pass away;<br>And the mighty are taken away, but by no human hand.',
'34:21': 'For His [a]eyes are upon the ways of a man,<br>And He sees all his steps.',
'34:22': 'There is no darkness and no shadow of death<br>Where the workers of iniquity may [a]hide themselves.',
'34:23': 'For He does not need to consider a man further,<br>That he should go to God in litigation.',
'34:24': 'He breaks mighty men in pieces without inquiry<br>And puts others in their stead.',
'34:25': 'Hence He knows their actions,<br>And He overturns them in the night so that they are crushed.',
'34:26': 'He strikes them as He would evil men,<br>In a place where all can see;',
'34:27': 'Because they turned aside from following after Him<br>And would not regard any of His ways,',
'34:28': 'So that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him,<br>And He heard the cry of the afflicted.',
'34:29': 'When He is silent, who can condemn Him?<br>When He hides His face, who can behold Him?<br>He does so toward a nation and toward a man alike,',
'34:30': 'That no profane man would reign, that there would be no snares for the<br>people.',
'34:31': 'For has anyone ever said to God,<br>I have borne chastisement; I will offend no more;',
'34:32': 'What I do not see teach me;<br>If I have committed iniquity, I will do it no more?',
'34:33': 'Should He recompense to fit you, since you have rejected it?<br>For you must choose, and not I.<br>So speak what you know.',
'34:34': 'Men of understanding will say to me,<br>As well as the man of wisdom who hears me,',
'34:35': 'Job has spoken without knowledge,<br>And his words are without insight.',
'34:36': 'I wish that Job were tried to the limit<br>Because of his answering like evil men.',
'34:37': 'For he adds [1]rebellion to his sin;<br>Among us he [2]claps his hands<br>And multiplies his words against God.',
'35:1': 'Then Elihu continued and said,',
'35:2': 'Do you consider this to be just?<br>Do you say, My [a]righteousness is more than God&rsquo;s,',
'35:3': 'So that you say, What [a]advantage is there to [1]me,<br>What do I profit, more than if I had sinned?',
'35:4': 'I will respond to you with words,<br>And to your companions with you.',
'35:5': 'Look unto heaven and see;<br>And behold the skies: They are higher than you.',
'35:6': 'If you [a]sin, what do you accomplish against Him?<br>And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to Him?',
'35:7': 'If you are [a]righteous, what can you [b]give to Him,<br>Or what does He receive from your hand?',
'35:8': 'Your wickedness affects a man like you,<br>And your righteousness, a son of man.',
'35:9': 'Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;<br>They cry for help because of the arm of the mighty.',
'35:10': 'But no one says, Where is God my [a]Maker,<br>Who gives [b]songs in the night,',
'35:11': 'Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth<br>And makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?',
'35:12': 'There they cry, but He does not answer,<br>Because of the pride of evil men.',
'35:13': 'Surely God does not hear an empty cry,<br>And the Almighty does not regard it.',
'35:14': 'How much less when you say that you do not behold Him,<br>That the cause is before Him and you are waiting on Him!',
'35:15': 'But now, because He has not visited in His anger<br>Nor regarded such great arrogance,',
'35:16': 'Job opens his mouth in vanity;<br>He multiplies words without knowledge.',
'36:1': 'And Elihu added this and said,',
'36:2': 'Bear with me a little, and I will show you;<br>For there is more to say for God.',
'36:3': 'I will bring my knowledge from afar<br>And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.',
'36:4': 'For truly my words are not false;<br>One perfect in [1]knowledge is with you.',
'36:5': 'Indeed, God is mighty and does not despise;<br>He is mighty in strength of understanding.',
'36:6': 'He does not preserve the wicked man alive,<br>But gives justice to the afflicted.',
'36:7': 'He does not withdraw His eyes from the righteous;<br>And with kings on the throne,<br>He sets them forever, and they are exalted.',
'36:8': 'And if they are bound in fetters,<br>If they are caught in the cords of affliction,',
'36:9': 'He shows them their work<br>And their transgressions, that they have acted arrogantly.',
'36:10': 'He also opens their ear to instruction<br>And commands that they return from iniquity.',
'36:11': 'If they hear and serve Him,<br>They will spend their days in prosperity<br>And their years in pleasantness.',
'36:12': 'But if they do not hear, they will pass away by the sword<br>And die without knowledge.',
'36:13': 'But those who are profane in heart [a]lay up anger;<br>They do not cry for help when He binds them.',
'36:14': 'They die in youth,<br>And their life ends among the most defiled.',
'36:15': 'He rescues the afflicted by their affliction<br>And opens their ear through oppression.',
'36:16': 'Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress<br>Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint;<br>And what is upon your table is full of fatness.',
'36:17': 'But you are filled with the judgment of the wicked;<br>Judgment and litigation have taken hold of you.',
'36:18': 'Beware lest wrath allures you into scoffing,<br>And do not let the greatness of the ransom turn you aside.',
'36:19': 'Will your cry keep you from being in distress,<br>Or all the forces of your strength?',
'36:20': 'Do not long for the night,<br>When people are taken from their place.',
'36:21': 'Take heed; do not turn toward iniquity;<br>For you have chosen this rather than affliction.',
'36:22': 'Indeed, God is exalted in His power:<br>Who is a teacher like Him?',
'36:23': 'Who has appointed His way for Him?<br>And who says, You have done wrong?',
'36:24': 'Remember to magnify His work,<br>Of which men sing.',
'36:25': 'All mankind has gazed on it;<br>Man beholds it from afar.',
'36:26': 'Indeed, God is great, and we do not know Him;<br>The number of His years we also cannot search out.',
'36:27': 'For He draws up the drops of water<br>Which distill into [a]rain from His mist,',
'36:28': 'Which the skies pour down<br>And drop upon man abundantly.',
'36:29': 'Can they indeed understand the spreading of the clouds,<br>The thunderings of His pavilion?',
'36:30': 'Indeed, He scatters His lightning around Him<br>And covers the roots of the sea.',
'36:31': 'For by these He judges the peoples;<br>He gives [a]food in abundance.',
'36:32': 'He fills His hands with lightning<br>And commands it to strike the mark.',
'36:33': 'Its noise tells of Him;<br>The cattle as well tell concerning Him who is coming.',
'37:1': 'At this, too, my heart trembles<br>And leaps from its place.',
'37:2': 'Hear attentively the noise of His voice<br>And the sound that goes forth from His mouth.',
'37:3': 'He sends it forth under the whole heaven,<br>And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.',
'37:4': 'After it a voice roars;<br>He thunders with the voice of His majesty<br>And does not withhold [1]the lightning<br>When His voice is heard.',
'37:5': 'God thunders wondrously with His voice;<br>He does great things that we cannot comprehend.',
'37:6': 'For He says to the [a]snow, Fall on the earth,<br>And to the rain shower and His mighty showers of rain.',
'37:7': 'He seals the hand of every man,<br>That all men may know His doing.',
'37:8': 'Then the beast enters its lair<br>And remains in its dens.',
'37:9': 'Out of its chamber comes the whirlwind,<br>And from scattering winds, cold.',
'37:10': 'From the breath of God [a]ice is yielded,<br>And the expanse of waters is frozen.',
'37:11': 'He also loads the thick clouds with moisture;<br>He scatters His lightning clouds;',
'37:12': 'And they turn about by His guidance,<br>That they may accomplish<br>All that He has commanded them<br>Upon the surface of the inhabited earth;',
'37:13': 'Whether for scourge or for His land<br>Or for lovingkindness&rsquo; sake, He causes it to happen.',
'37:14': 'Give ear to this, Job;<br>Stand still and consider the wondrous acts of God.',
'37:15': 'Do you know how God lays His charge upon them<br>And causes His lightning clouds to shine?',
'37:16': 'Do you know about the balancing of the thick clouds,<br>The wondrous acts of Him who is perfect in knowledge?',
'37:17': 'You whose garments heat up<br>When, because of the [a]south wind, the earth is still,',
'37:18': 'Can you spread out the skies with Him,<br>The skies which are as hard as a molten mirror?',
'37:19': 'Teach us what to say to Him;<br>We cannot arrange our words because of the darkness.',
'37:20': 'Should it be said to Him, I will speak?<br>Or should a man say that he will be swallowed up?',
'37:21': 'But now men do not look at the light,<br>Which is brilliant in the skies<br>When the wind has passed and cleared them.',
'37:22': 'Out of the north comes golden splendor;<br>Upon God is the awesomeness of majesty.',
'37:23': 'The Almighty&mdash;we cannot find Him out;<br>He is excellent in power,<br>And justice and the abundance of righteousness He will not damage.',
'37:24': 'Therefore men fear Him;<br>He does not look upon any who are wise of heart.',
'38:1': '[a]Then Jehovah [1]answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,',
'38:2': 'Who is this who darkens counsel<br>By words without [a]knowledge?',

'42:7': 'And after Jehovah had spoken these words to Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My anger is kindled against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken concerning Me that which is right, as My servant Job [1]has.',
'42:8': 'Now therefore take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to My servant Job, and offer them as a [a]burnt offering for yourselves.

'42:9': 'So [1]Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as Jehovah told them; and Jehovah accepted Job.',
'42:10': 'And Jehovah [a]turned the captivity of Job when he prayed for his friends, and Jehovah gave Job [1b]twice as much as he had before.',
'42:11': 'And all his brothers and all his sisters and all his previous acquaintances came to him and ate bread with him in his house. And they consoled and comforted him for all the misfortune that Jehovah had brought upon him. And each gave to him a piece of money, and each, a gold ring.',
'42:12': 'Thus Jehovah blessed Job&rsquo;s latter [a]end more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand [b]sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand female donkeys.',
'42:13': 'And he had [a]seven sons and three daughters.',
'42:14': 'And he named the first Jemimah, and the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.',
'42:15': 'And in all the land no women were found as beautiful as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.',
'42:16': 'And after this, Job lived a hundred and forty years; and he saw his children and his grandchildren, even four generations.',
'42:17': 'And Job died, old and full of days[1].',

This revelation was given not to Job but to Paul. As unveiled in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with us is to strip us of all things and to consume us so that we may gain God more and more ({Phi3:8|Phil. 3:8}; {2Co4:16|2&nbsp;Cor. 4:16}).

Rather, God created man in His own image and according to His likeness that man may express God ({Gen1:26|Gen. 1:26} and {Gen1:26^1|notes}). To express God is higher than fearing God and turning away from evil.","Job was also a man of integrity ({Job2:3|2:3}, {Job2:9|9}; {Job27:5|27:5}; {Job31:6|31:6}).

The scene in vv. {Job1:6|6}-{Job1:8|8} depicts one of the two councils held in heaven concerning Job. What Job had attained in his perfection, uprightness, and integrity was altogether vanity. It neither fulfilled God&rsquo;s purpose nor satisfied God&rsquo;s desire.

Yet in His wisdom and sovereignty God did not execute His judgment on Satan. God still has given Satan a certain limited time to do something to meet some negative need in the fulfillment of His economy. God could not and would not ask any of His many excellent angels to do what was needed to damage Job in order to strip him of everything so that he might be full of God. Satan was the unique one in the universe who could and who would fulfill God&rsquo;s intention of stripping Job of his possessions and his ethical attainment. Thus, the scene here and in {Job2|ch. 2} shows that Satan remains free to be purposely used by God as an ugly tool to execute God&rsquo;s severe dealing with his loving ones.","Two thousand years after the time of Job, Jesus Christ destroyed Satan through His death on the cross ({Heb2:14|Heb. 2:14}). However, Satan&rsquo;s right to enter into the presence of God still has not been taken away from him (cf. {Rev12:10|Rev. 12:10}). This right will be taken away at the beginning of the great tribulation. When the overcomers are raptured to God&rsquo;s throne, Satan will be cast down from the heavens to the earth ({Rev12:5|Rev. 12:5}, {Rev12:7|7}-{Rev12:9|9}).

The scene here indicates that Job and his friends were ignorant concerning that most painful and most terrifying occurrence, and were puzzled in their godliness, unable to discern what the reason was, what the purpose was, and what the result would be. Actually, Job&rsquo;s experience was a step taken by God in His divine economy to carry out the consuming and stripping of the contented Job in order to usher Job into a deeper seeking after God, that he might gain God instead of His blessings and his attainments in his perfection and integrity. God&rsquo;s stripping and consuming were exercised over Job to tear Job down that God might have a base and a way to rebuild him with God Himself that he might become a God-man, the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead, in order to express God.","The divine revelation in the Bible is progressive. Up to Job&rsquo;s time the progression of the divine revelation had reached only the level of Abraham&rsquo;s time, that is, that sinners need God&rsquo;s redemption with the shedding of the blood of the burnt offering ({Job1:5|1:5}; {Job42:8|42:8}). The divine truths regarding such matters as regeneration ({Joh3:6|John 3:6}; {1Pe1:23|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:23}), renewing ({2Co4:16|2&nbsp;Cor. 4:16}; {Eph4:23|Eph. 4:23}), transformation ({Rom12:2|Rom. 12:2}; {2Co3:18|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18}), conformation ({Rom8:29|Rom. 8:29}), and glorification ({Rom8:23|Rom. 8:23}, {Rom8:30|30}; {Phi3:21|Phil. 3:21}) were not explicitly revealed to man in God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy. God could not speak such things to Job and his friends because they were in a primitive stage of the divine revelation (cf. {Joh3:7|John 3:7}-{Joh3:12|12}; {Joh16:12|16:12}-{Joh16:13|13}). These things were not revealed in completion until the apostle Paul&rsquo;s time. Paul received a full and explicit revelation of things concerning which Job and his friends had no understanding ({Eph3:3|Eph. 3:3}-{Eph3:6|6}, {Eph3:9|9}-{Eph3:11|11}; {Col1:25|Col. 1:25}-{Col1:27|27}). Without the Epistles of Paul it would be difficult to understand the book of Job, because the conclusion of Job does not give us an explicit view concerning the purpose of God&rsquo;s dealing with His people. However, in the view of the New Testament it is very clear that God&rsquo;s purpose in dealing with His holy people is that they would be emptied of everything and receive only God as their gain ({Phi3:8|Phil. 3:8}; cf. {Psa73:25|Psa. 73:25}-{Psa73:26|26}). The desire of God&rsquo;s heart is that we would gain Him in full as life, as the life supply, and as everything to our being."]},

Rather, he became bankrupt in integrity.","God&rsquo;s intention with Job was to consume him and to strip him of his attainments, his achievements, in the highest standard of ethics in perfection and uprightness ({Job1:1|1:1}). God&rsquo;s intention was also to tear down the natural Job in his perfection and uprightness that He might build up a renewed Job in God&rsquo;s nature and attributes. God&rsquo;s intention was not to have a Job in the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but a Job in the line of the tree of life ({Gen2:9|Gen. 2:9}).

In the New Testament God&rsquo;s consuming and stripping become pleasant things. From the day he was converted, Paul was a person under God&rsquo;s consuming and God&rsquo;s stripping ({2Co4:8|2&nbsp;Cor. 4:8}-{2Co4:18|18}; {Phi3:7|Phil. 3:7}-{Phi3:8|8}).

In contrast, Job did not rejoice but was constantly vexed.","In his experience of God&rsquo;s consuming and stripping, Paul was not constricted by the pressures on every side and did not perish despite his being cast down ({2Co4:8|2&nbsp;Cor. 4:8}-{2Co4:9|9}). He did not lose heart, but he expected to be put to death that he might manifest Christ&rsquo;s life, and to be consumed day by day that he might be renewed and, through the momentary lightness of his affliction, add to the eternal weight of glory that he would share in the ages to come ({2Co4:10|2&nbsp;Cor. 4:10}-{2Co4:12|12}, {2Co4:16|16}-{2Co4:17|17}; cf. {Rom8:18|Rom. 8:18}). Unlike Job, Paul did not curse the day of his birth, and he did not say that he preferred to die rather than to live. On the contrary, after much consideration Paul said that he still preferred to live, not to die, because to him to live was Christ ({Phi1:21|Phil. 1:21}-{Phi1:25|25}). Paul&rsquo;s living Christ was for him to magnify Christ, whether through life or through death, by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ({Phi1:19|Phil. 1:19}-{Phi1:20|20}). He did not care for life or death; he cared only to live Christ for His magnification. When God created man, this is the kind of life He wanted man to live."]},

Before the New Testament time He did not unveil to anyone what His purpose was ({Eph3:4|Eph. 3:4}-{Eph3:5|5}).","The mystery hidden in God&rsquo;s heart is God&rsquo;s eternal economy ({Eph1:10|Eph. 1:10}; {Eph3:9|3:9}; {1Ti1:4|1&nbsp;Tim. 1:4}), which is God&rsquo;s eternal intention with His heart&rsquo;s desire to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity as the Father in the Son by the Spirit into His chosen people to be their life and nature that they may be the same as He is as His duplication ({Rom8:29|Rom. 8:29}; {1Jo3:2|1&nbsp;John 3:2}), to become an organism, the Body of Christ as the new man ({Eph2:15|Eph. 2:15}-{Eph2:16|16}), for God&rsquo;s fullness, God&rsquo;s expression ({Eph1:22|Eph. 1:22}-{Eph1:23|23}; {Eph3:19|3:19}), which will consummate in the New Jerusalem ({Rev21:2|Rev. 21:2}&mdash;{Rev22:5|22:5}). Not knowing God&rsquo;s intention, Job misunderstood God and thought that God was angry with him and was judging him and punishing him. God&rsquo;s intention was not to judge Job or to punish him but to tear him down and then rebuild him with Himself, to make Job a new man in God&rsquo;s new creation ({2Co5:17|2&nbsp;Cor. 5:17}; {Gal6:15|Gal. 6:15}). This is the answer to Job, to the book of Job, and to Job&rsquo;s vindication."]},

This answer is the eternal economy of God according to His good pleasure, which is to dispense Himself in His Divine Trinity&mdash;in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit&mdash;through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, with the outpouring of the Spirit, into His chosen and redeemed people, to make all of them the same as He is in life and in nature but not in the Godhead, to make them His duplication that they may express Him ({Rom8:28|Rom. 8:28}-{Rom8:29|29} and {Rom8:28^1|notes}). The issue of such a divine dispensing is the church as the Body of Christ, as the new man, and as the organism of the Triune God. This organism will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the enlarged, the increased, incarnation of God consummated in full, that is, the fullness of the Triune God ({Eph3:19|Eph. 3:19}) for Him to express Himself corporately in His divinity mingled with humanity for eternity. This is the divine revelation in the New Testament as the answer to the sufferings of Job and to the great question concerning God&rsquo;s purpose in His creation of man and in His dealing with His chosen people."]},
