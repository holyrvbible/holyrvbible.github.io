verses: {
'1:1': 'The vision of [1]Obadiah.<br class="split">Thus says the Lord Jehovah concerning [2a]Edom,<br>[b]We have heard a report from Jehovah,<br>And an envoy has been sent among the nations:<br>Arise, and let us rise up against it for battle.',
'1:2': 'Indeed I have made you small among the nations;<br>You are very despised.',
'1:3': 'The arrogance of your heart has beguiled you,<br>O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock,<br>Whose habitation is lofty,<br>Who says in his heart,<br>Who will bring me down to the ground?',
'1:4': 'Though you set yourself on high like the eagle<br>And though you make your nest among the stars,<br>I will [a]bring you down from there,<br>Declares Jehovah.',
'1:5': 'If [a]thieves came to you,<br>If spoilers in the night&mdash;<br>How you would be cut off!&mdash;<br>Would they not steal only their fill?<br>If grape gatherers came to you,<br>Would they not leave gleanings?',
'1:6': 'How thoroughly searched Esau is!<br>How sought out his hidden treasures are!',
'1:7': 'All the men of your [1]confederacy<br>Have sent you away to the border;<br>The men who were at peace with you<br>Have deceived you; they have prevailed against you.<br>They make your bread<br>A snare under you.<br>There is no understanding in him.',
'1:8': 'Will I not in that day,<br>Declares Jehovah,<br>Destroy the wise men from Edom,<br>And understanding from the mountain of Esau?',
'1:9': 'And your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman,<br>So that each one is cut off from the mountain of Esau by slaughter.',
'1:10': 'Because of the [a]violence against your [1]brother Jacob,<br>Shame will cover you, and you will be cut off [b]forever.',
'1:11': 'In the day that you stood on the side,<br>In the day that strangers took his substance captive<br>And foreigners entered into his gates<br>And [a]cast lots over Jerusalem,<br>You also were like one of them.',
'1:12': 'But do not look to the day of your brother,<br>To the day of his misfortune;<br>[a]Neither rejoice concerning the children of Judah<br>In the day of their destruction,<br>Nor boast<br>In the day of distress.',
'1:13': 'Do not enter the gate of My people<br>In the day of their calamity;<br>Do not look, even you, on his affliction<br>In the day of his calamity,<br>Nor send forth your hands on his substance<br>In the day of his calamity.',
'1:14': 'And do not stand at the crossroads<br>To cut off those of his who escape,<br>Nor deliver those of his who survive<br>In the day of distress.',
'1:15': 'For the [1a]day of Jehovah is near<br>Upon all the nations:<br>[2]As you have done, it [b]will be done to you;<br>Your recompense will return upon your head.',
'1:16': 'For as you have [a]drunk the cup of wrath upon My holy mountain,<br>All the nations will drink the same continually;<br>Indeed they will drink and swallow down,<br>And they will be as though they had not been.',
'1:17': '[1]But in Mount [a]Zion<br>There will be those who have escaped,<br>And it will be holy.<br>And the house of Jacob will possess<br>Their possessions.',
'1:18': 'And the house of Jacob will be a fire,<br>And the house of Joseph a flame;<br>And the house of Esau will be as stubble,<br>And they will burn among them and devour them;<br>And there will be no survivor<br>To the house of Esau,<br>For Jehovah has spoken.',
'1:19': 'And those of the south will possess the mountain of Esau,<br>And those of the lowlands, the Philistines;<br>Indeed they will possess the field of Ephraim<br>And the field of Samaria,<br>And Benjamin will possess Gilead.',
'1:20': 'And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel,<br>Who are among the Canaanites, will possess as far as Zarephath;<br>And the captivity of Jerusalem, who are in Sepharad,<br>Will possess the cities of the south.',
'1:21': 'And saviors will come up on Mount Zion<br>To judge the mountain of Esau,<br>And the [a]kingdom will be Jehovah&rsquo;s.',

All the aforementioned items were fulfilled at the time of the Maccabees, and they will be much more fulfilled in glory at the time of restoration for the kingdom of God ({Mat19:28|Matt. 19:28}; {Rev11:15|Rev. 11:15}). The Maccabees, taking Mount Zion as their ground to judge Edom, gained a victory over Antiochus Epiphanes in about 165 B.C. ({Dan8:9|Dan. 8:9}-{Dan8:14|14} and {Dan8:9^1|notes}; {Zec9:11|Zech. 9:11}-{Zec9:17|17} and {Zec9:11^1|notes}). The victory of the Maccabees was a type of the victory Israel will gain immediately before the age of restoration.","The Minor Prophets, including Obadiah, reveal that the nations used by God to chastise sinful Israel do things in excess. Therefore, God will come in to judge the nations. This judgment will issue in Israel&rsquo;s gaining the victory and enlarging their territory for the kingdom of God on earth, especially for God&rsquo;s kingdom in the time of restoration.
