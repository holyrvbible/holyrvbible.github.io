'1:2': 'To Timothy, beloved [a]child: Grace, [1b]mercy, peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.',
'1:3': 'I thank God, whom I [1a]serve [2]from <I>my</I> [b]forefathers in a [3c]pure conscience, while unceasingly I have remembrance concerning you in my petitions [d]night and day,',
'1:4': '[a]Longing to see you, remembering your [b]tears, that I may be [c]filled with joy;',
'1:5': 'Having been reminded of the [a]unfeigned faith in you, which [1]dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your [b]mother Eunice, and I am persuaded <I>dwells</I> also in you.',
'1:6': 'For which cause I remind you to [1]fan into flame the [a]gift of God, which is in you through the [2b]laying on of my hands.',
'1:7': 'For God has not given us a [1a]spirit of [b]cowardice, but [2]of [c]power and of [d]love and of [e]sobermindedness.',
'1:8': '[1]Therefore do [2]not be [a]ashamed of the [b]testimony of our Lord nor of me [c]His prisoner; but [d]suffer evil with the [3e]gospel [4]according to the [f]power of God;',
'1:9': 'Who has saved us and [1a]called us with a holy calling, not according to our [b]works but according to His own [2c]purpose and [d]grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus [3]before the [e]times of the ages',
'1:10': 'But now has been [1a]manifested through the [b]appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who [2]nullified [c]death and brought [3d]life and [4e]incorruption to light through the gospel,',
'1:11': 'For [1]which I was [a]appointed a [2]herald and an apostle and a teacher.',
'1:12': 'For which [1]cause also I [a]suffer these things; but I am [2]not [b]ashamed, for I know [3]whom I have [c]believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to [d]guard [4]my [e]deposit unto [5f]that day.',
'1:13': '[a]Hold a [1]pattern of the [2b]healthy words that you have [c]heard from me, in the [3d]faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.',
'1:14': '[a]Guard the good [1]deposit through the Holy [b]Spirit who [2]dwells in us.',
'1:15': 'This you know, that all who are in [1a]Asia [2b]turned away from me, of whom are [3]Phygelus and Hermogenes.',
'1:16': 'May the Lord grant [a]mercy to the house of [1b]Onesiphorus, for he often [c]refreshed me and was not [d]ashamed of my [e]chain;',
'1:17': 'But being in [a]Rome, he sought me out diligently and found <I>me</I>.',
'1:18': 'May the Lord grant him to find [a]mercy from the Lord in [1b]that day. And in how many things he served <I>me</I> in [c]Ephesus, you know best.',
'2:1': 'You therefore, my [a]child, be [1b]empowered in the [2c]grace which is in Christ Jesus;',
'2:2': 'And the [1]things which you have [a]heard from me through many [b]witnesses, these [2c]commit to [3d]faithful men, who will be competent to [e]teach others also.',
'2:3': '[a]Suffer evil with <I>me</I> as a good [1b]soldier of Christ Jesus.',
'2:4': 'No one serving as a soldier [1a]entangles himself with the [b]affairs of this [2]life, that he may please the one who enlisted <I>him</I>.',
'2:5': 'And also if anyone [1a]contends <I>in</I> <I>the</I> <I>games</I>, he is not [2b]crowned unless he contends lawfully.',
'2:6': 'The laboring [1a]farmer must be the first to partake of the fruit.',
'2:7': 'Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in all things.',
'2:8': 'Remember Jesus Christ, [1a]raised from the dead, of the [2b]seed of David, according to [3c]my gospel,',
'2:9': 'In which I [a]suffer evil unto [b]bonds as a [c]criminal; but the [d]word of God is [1]not bound.',
'2:10': 'Therefore I [a]endure all things for the sake of the [1b]chosen ones, that they themselves also may obtain the [c]salvation which is in Christ Jesus [2]with [d]eternal glory.',
'2:11': '[a]Faithful is the word: [1]For if we [2b]died with <I>Him</I>, we will also [3c]live with <I>Him</I>;',
'2:12': 'If we [1a]endure, we will also [2b]reign with <I>Him</I>; if we [c]deny <I>Him</I>, He also will [3]deny us;',
'2:13': 'If we are [a]faithless, He remains [1]faithful, for He [2b]cannot deny Himself.',
'2:14': 'Remind <I>them</I> of these things, solemnly [a]charging <I>them</I> before God not to have [b]contentions of words, <I>which</I> <I>is</I> [c]useful for nothing, to the [1]ruin of those who hear.',
'2:15': 'Be diligent to [a]present yourself [b]approved to God, an unashamed workman, [1]cutting straight the [c]word of the [2d]truth.',
'2:16': 'But [a]avoid [1b]profane, [c]vain babblings, for they will advance to more [2d]ungodliness,',
'2:17': 'And their word will [1]spread like [2]gangrene, of whom are [a]Hymenaeus and Philetus,',
'2:18': 'Who concerning the [1a]truth have [2b]misaimed, saying that the [c]resurrection has [3]already taken place, and overthrow the [4d]faith of some.',
'2:19': 'However the firm [1a]foundation of God stands, having this [2b]seal, The Lord [c]knows those who are His, and, Let everyone who [d]names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.',
'2:20': '[1]But in a [2]great house there are not only [3]gold and silver vessels but also [4]wooden and earthen; and some are unto [a]honor, and some unto dishonor.',
'2:21': 'If therefore anyone [1]cleanses himself from [2a]these, he will be a [b]vessel [3]unto honor, [c]sanctified, [d]useful to the master, [e]prepared unto every good work.',
'2:22': 'But [a]flee youthful [1]lusts, and [b]pursue [2]righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who [3c]call on the Lord out of a [4d]pure heart.',
'2:23': 'But [1a]foolish [b]questionings and those arising from an [2]untrained mind refuse, knowing that they beget contentions.',
'2:24': 'But a [a]slave of the Lord ought [b]not to contend but be gentle toward all, apt to [c]teach, bearing with wrong;',
'2:25': 'In [a]meekness correcting those who [b]oppose, if perhaps God may give them [1c]repentance unto the [2d]full knowledge of the truth,',
'2:26': 'And they may [1a]return to soberness out of the [2b]snare of the [3]devil, having been caught alive by him, unto [4c]His will.',
'3:1': '[1]But know this, that in the [2]last days [3]difficult [a]times will come.',
'3:2': 'For [1]men will be [2]lovers of self, [a]lovers of money, [b]boasters, [3]arrogant, [4c]revilers, [b]disobedient to parents, [5]unthankful, [d]unholy,',
'3:3': '[a]Without natural affection, [1]implacable, [b]slanderers, [c]without self-control, savage, [c]not lovers of good,',
'3:4': '[1a]Traitors, [2]reckless, [3b]blinded with pride, [4]lovers of [c]pleasure rather than [d]lovers of God,',
'3:5': 'Having an [1]outward [a]form of [b]godliness, though [c]denying its [2]power; from these also [d]turn away.',
'3:6': 'For of these are those who [a]creep into [b]houses and take captive silly women heaped with sins, who are led by [c]various desires',
'3:7': '<I>And</I> are always learning yet never able to come to the [1a]full knowledge of the truth.',
'3:8': 'And in the manner that [1]Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these also [a]oppose the [2b]truth; men [c]corrupted in mind, [3d]disapproved concerning the [4e]faith.',
'3:9': 'But they will not [a]advance farther, for their [1]folly will be completely manifest to all, as also the <I>folly</I> of [2]those became.',
'3:10': 'But you have [a]closely followed my teaching, [1]conduct, [2b]purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,',
'3:11': '[a]Persecutions, sufferings, such as befell me in [b]Antioch, in [c]Iconium, in [1d]Lystra. Such persecutions I bore, and out of them all the Lord [e]delivered me.',
'3:12': 'And indeed all who [1]desire to [2]live [a]godly in Christ Jesus will be [b]persecuted.',
'3:13': 'But evil men and [1]impostors will grow worse and worse, [a]deceiving and being deceived.',
'3:14': 'But you, [1]continue in the [2]things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned <I>them</I>',
'3:15': '[1]And that [a]from a babe you have known the [b]sacred writings, which are able to make you [c]wise unto [d]salvation through the [2]faith which is in Christ Jesus.',
'3:16': '[1]All [a]Scripture is [2]God-breathed and profitable for [b]teaching, for [3]conviction, for [4]correction, for [5]instruction in righteousness,',
'3:17': 'That the [1a]man of God may be [2]complete, fully [3b]equipped for every good work.',
'4:1': 'I solemnly [a]charge <I>you</I> before God and Christ Jesus, who is to [1b]judge the living and the dead, and by [2]His [c]appearing and His [d]kingdom:',
'4:2': 'Proclaim the [1a]word; [2]be ready [3]in season <I>and</I> out of season; [b]convict, [4]rebuke, [c]exhort with [5]all [d]long-suffering and [e]teaching.',
'4:3': 'For the [1a]time will come when they will not tolerate the [2b]healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having [3]itching ears,',
'4:4': 'And they will [1a]turn away their ear from the [2]truth and will be turned aside to [3b]myths.',
'4:5': 'But you, be [a]sober in all things, [b]suffer evil, do the work of an [c]evangelist, [1]fully accomplish your [2d]ministry.',
'4:6': 'For I am already being [1a]poured out, and the time of my [2b]departure is at hand.',
'4:7': 'I have [1a]fought the good fight; I have [2b]finished the course; I have kept the [c]faith.',
'4:8': 'Henceforth there is [1]laid up for me the [2a]crown of [b]righteousness, with which the Lord, the [3c]righteous Judge, will [d]recompense me in [4e]that day, and not only me but also all those who have [f]loved His [5g]appearing.',
'4:9': 'Be diligent to [a]come to me quickly;',
'4:10': 'For [a]Demas has [b]abandoned me, having [1c]loved the [d]present age, and has gone to [e]Thessalonica; Crescens to [f]Galatia; [g]Titus to [2]Dalmatia.',
'4:11': '[a]Luke alone is with me. Take [b]Mark and bring <I>him</I> with you, for he is useful to me for the [c]ministry.',

'4:13': 'The [1]cloak which I left in [2a]Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the [3]scrolls, especially the parchments.',

'4:15': 'You also guard against him, for he greatly opposed our words.',
'4:16': 'At my first defense no one was with me to support me, but all [a]abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.',
'4:17': 'But the Lord [a]stood with me and [b]empowered me that through me the [c]proclamation <I>of</I> <I>the</I> <I>gospel</I> might be fully accomplished and all the [d]Gentiles might hear; and I was [e]delivered out of the [1f]lion&rsquo;s mouth.',

Many had turned away from him and forsaken him ({2Ti1:15|v. 15}; {2Ti4:16|4:16}), including even some of his co-workers ({2Ti4:10|4:10}). It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his young fellow worker and spiritual child, Timothy. Because of this, in the opening of this encouraging, strengthening, and establishing Epistle, he confirmed to Timothy that he was an apostle of Christ not only through the will of God but also according to the promise of life, which is in Christ. This implies that though the churches may become degraded and many of the saints may backslide in unfaithfulness, the eternal life, the divine life, the uncreated life of God, promised by God in His holy writings and given to the apostle and all the believers, remains forever the same. With and upon this unchanging life the firm foundation of God was laid and stands unshaken through all the tide of degradation ({2Ti2:19|2:19}). By such a life those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart are able to stand the test of the church&rsquo;s decline. This life, which the apostle in 1&nbsp;Timothy charged Timothy and others to lay hold on ({1Ti6:12|1&nbsp;Tim. 6:12}, {1Ti6:19|19}), must have been an encouragement and strengthening to the apostle in perilous times."]},

The answer to both questions is that he and his co-workers were under the discipline of the inner life in that time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift. The former is a matter of grace in life; the latter is a matter of gift in power&mdash;miraculous power. In the decline of the church and in one&rsquo;s suffering for the church, the gift of power is not needed as much as the grace in life."]},
