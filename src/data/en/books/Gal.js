verses: {
'1:1': '[1a]Paul, an [b]apostle ([2c]not from men nor through man but [d]through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who [3e]raised Him from the dead),',
'1:2': 'And all the [1a]brothers who are with me, to the [2b]churches of [c]Galatia:',
'1:3': '[1a]Grace to you and [2b]peace from God [c]our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,',
'1:4': 'Who [a]gave Himself for our [b]sins that He might [1]rescue us out of the present evil [2c]age according to the [d]will of our God and Father,',
'1:5': 'To whom be the [a]glory forever and ever. Amen.',
'1:6': 'I marvel that you are so quickly [1]removing from Him who has [a]called you [2]in the [3b]grace of Christ to a [4c]different gospel,',
'1:7': 'Which is [1]not another <I>gospel</I>, only there are [2]some who [a]trouble you and desire to [3]pervert the gospel of Christ.',
'1:8': 'But if even we or an [a]angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be [b]accursed.',
'1:9': 'As we have said before, now also I say again, If anyone announces to you a gospel beyond that which you have received, let him be accursed.',
'1:10': 'For am I now [1]trying to win the assent of men or of God? Or am I seeking to [a]please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a [b]slave of Christ.',
'1:11': 'For I make known to you, [a]brothers, <I>concerning</I> the [b]gospel announced by me, that it is [c]not according to man.',
'1:12': 'For [1]neither did I receive <I>it</I> from man, nor was I taught it, but I [a]received it through a [2b]revelation by Jesus Christ.',
'1:13': 'For you have heard of my manner of life [a]formerly in [1]Judaism, that I [b]persecuted the [c]church of God excessively and [d]ravaged it.',
'1:14': 'And I [a]advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a [b]zealot for the [1c]traditions of my [d]fathers.',
'1:15': 'But when it [a]pleased God, who [1]set me apart [2]from my mother&rsquo;s [b]womb and [3c]called me through His [4d]grace,',
'1:16': 'To [1a]reveal His [2b]Son [3]in me that I might announce [4]Him as the gospel among the [5c]Gentiles, immediately I did [6]not confer with [7d]flesh and blood,',
'1:17': '[a]Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to [1b]Arabia and again returned to [c]Damascus.',
'1:18': 'Then after three years I went up to [a]Jerusalem to [1]visit [b]Cephas, and I remained with him fifteen days.',
'1:19': 'But I saw none of the other apostles [1]except [a]James, the brother of the Lord.',
'1:20': 'Now concerning the things which I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am [a]not lying.',
'1:21': 'Then I went into the regions of [1a]Syria and [b]Cilicia.',
'1:22': 'Yet I was still [1]unknown by face to the [a]churches of Judea, which are [b]in Christ.',
'1:23': 'But they [1]only heard <I>this</I>: He who was formerly [a]persecuting us is now announcing as the gospel the [2b]faith which formerly he [c]ravaged.',
'1:24': 'And they [a]glorified God because of me.',
'2:1': 'Then [1]after a period of fourteen years I [a]went up again to Jerusalem with [b]Barnabas, taking [c]Titus with <I>me</I> also.',
'2:2': 'And I went up according to [1a]revelation, and I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the [b]Gentiles, but privately to those who were of [c]repute, [d]lest perhaps I should be [e]running, or had run, in vain.',
'2:3': 'But [1]not even Titus, who was with me, though he is a Greek, was compelled to be [2a]circumcised;',
'2:4': 'And <I>this</I>, because of the [1a]false brothers, brought in [b]secretly, who stole in to spy out our [2c]freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into [3d]slavery.',
'2:5': 'To them we yielded with the subjection <I>demanded</I> not even for an hour, that the [1a]truth of the gospel might remain with you.',
'2:6': 'But from those who were [a]reputed to be something&mdash;whatever they were makes no difference to me; God does [b]not accept man&rsquo;s person; for to me those who were of repute added nothing.',
'2:7': 'But on the contrary, seeing that I had been [a]entrusted with the gospel to the [b]uncircumcision, even as [c]Peter <I>with</I> <I>the</I> <I>gospel</I> to the circumcision,',
'2:8': '(For He who operated in Peter for the [a]apostleship to the circumcision operated also in me for the [b]Gentiles),',
'2:9': 'And perceiving the [a]grace given to me, [1b]James and [c]Cephas and [d]John, who were [e]reputed to be [f]pillars, gave to me and to [g]Barnabas the right [h]hand of [i]fellowship that we <I>should</I> <I>go</I> to the Gentiles, and they, to the circumcision.',
'2:10': 'Only <I>they</I> <I>requested</I> that we remember the [a]poor, which very thing I [b]was also eager to do.',
'2:11': 'But when [a]Cephas came to [b]Antioch, I opposed him to <I>his</I> face because he stood condemned.',
'2:12': 'For before some came [1]from [a]James, he [2]continually [b]ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to shrink back and separate himself, [3]fearing those of the [c]circumcision.',
'2:13': 'And the [1]rest of the Jews also joined him in this [2]hypocrisy, so that even [3a]Barnabas was carried away in their hypocrisy.',
'2:14': 'But when I saw that they were not [1]walking in a [a]straightforward way in relation to the [b]truth of the gospel, I said to [c]Cephas [d]before <I>them</I> all, If you, being a Jew, [2e]live like the Gentiles and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the Gentiles to [3f]live like the Jews?',
'2:15': 'We are [a]Jews by nature and not [b]sinners from among the Gentiles;',
'2:16': 'And knowing that a man is not justified out of works of [a]law, but through [1b]faith in Jesus Christ, we also have believed into Christ Jesus that we might be justified out of faith in Christ and not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law [c]no [2]flesh will be justified.',
'2:17': 'But if, while seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also have been found [a]sinners, is then Christ a [1]minister of sin? [2b]Absolutely not!',
'2:18': 'For if I [1]build again the things which I have [2]destroyed, I prove myself to be a transgressor.',
'2:19': 'For I [1]through law have [2a]died to law that I might [3b]live to God.',
'2:20': 'I am [1a]crucified with Christ; and <I>it</I> <I>is</I> [2]no longer I <I>who</I> live, but <I>it</I> <I>is</I> [3b]Christ <I>who</I> lives in me; and the [4]<I>life</I> which I now live in the flesh I [c]live in [5]faith, the [d]<I>faith</I> [6]of the [7]Son of God, who [8e]loved me and [f]gave Himself up for me.',
'2:21': 'I do not nullify the [1a]grace of God; for if [2b]righteousness is through law, then [c]Christ has died [3]for nothing.',
'3:1': 'O foolish [a]Galatians, [b]who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed [1c]crucified?',
'3:2': 'This only I wish to learn from you, Did you [1]receive the [2a]Spirit out of the [3b]works of law or out of the [3c]hearing of [d]faith?',
'3:3': 'Are you so foolish? Having [1]begun by the [2]Spirit, are you now being [1]perfected by the [2a]flesh?',
'3:4': 'Have you [1a]suffered so many things [b]in vain, if indeed it was in vain?',
'3:5': 'He therefore who [1]bountifully [a]supplies to you the [2b]Spirit and [3c]does works of power among you, <I>does</I> <I>He</I> <I>do</I> <I>it</I> out of the [4d]works of law or out of the hearing of faith?',
'3:6': 'Even as [1a]&ldquo;Abraham [b]believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.&rdquo;',
'3:7': 'Know then that they who are of [1a]faith, these are [2b]sons of Abraham.',
'3:8': 'And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would [a]justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the [1]gospel beforehand to Abraham: [b]&ldquo;In you shall all the nations be [c]blessed.&rdquo;',
'3:9': 'So then they who are of [1a]faith are [2]blessed with [3]believing Abraham.',
'3:10': 'For as many as are of the [a]works of law are under a [1b]curse; for it is written, [c]&ldquo;Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law to do them.&rdquo;',
'3:11': 'And that [1]by law [a]no one is justified before God is evident because, [b]&ldquo;The righteous one shall have life and [c]live [2]by faith&rdquo;;',
'3:12': 'But the law is not of faith, yet, [a]&ldquo;He who does them shall live [1]because of them.&rdquo;',
'3:13': 'Christ has [a]redeemed us out of the [b]curse of the law, having [1]become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, [c]&ldquo;Cursed is everyone hanging on a [2d]tree&rdquo;;',
'3:14': 'In order that the [1a]blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles [b]in Christ Jesus, that we might [2c]receive the [d]promise of the [3e]Spirit through [f]faith.',
'3:15': 'Brothers, I speak [a]according to man, though <I>it</I> <I>is</I> a man&rsquo;s covenant, yet when it has been ratified, no one nullifies <I>it</I> or makes additions <I>to</I> <I>it</I>.',
'3:16': 'But [a]to Abraham were the [b]promises spoken and [c]to his seed. He does not say, &ldquo;And to the seeds,&rdquo; as concerning many, but as concerning one: &ldquo;And to your [d]seed,&rdquo; who is [1e]Christ.',
'3:17': 'And I say this: A [1]covenant previously ratified by God, the [2]law, having come [3a]four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul so as to make the [b]promise of none effect.',
'3:18': 'For if the [1a]inheritance is of law, it is no longer of promise; but to Abraham God has graciously given <I>it</I> through [b]promise.',
'3:19': 'Why then the [a]law? It was [1]added because of the [b]transgressions until the [c]seed should come to whom the promise was made, it being [2]ordained through [d]angels in the hand of a [3e]mediator.',
'3:20': 'But a [1a]mediator is not <I>a</I> <I>mediator</I> for one, but God is [b]one.',
'3:21': 'Is then the law against the promises of God? [a]Absolutely not! For if a law had been given which was able to [1]give life, [2b]righteousness would have indeed been of law.',
'3:22': 'But the Scripture has [1a]shut up [2]all under [b]sin in order that the [c]promise out of [3d]faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who [e]believe.',
'3:23': 'But before [1a]faith came we were [2b]guarded [c]under law, being [3d]shut up [4]unto the [1a]faith which was to be revealed.',
'3:24': 'So then the [a]law has become our [1]child-conductor unto [b]Christ that we might be justified out of [c]faith.',
'3:25': 'But since [a]faith has come, we are [1]no longer [b]under a child-conductor.',
'3:26': 'For you are all [1a]sons of God through [2b]faith [c]in Christ Jesus.',
'3:27': 'For as many of you as were [a]baptized [1]into Christ have [b]put on Christ.',
'3:28': 'There [1]cannot be [2a]Jew nor Greek, there cannot be [3]slave nor free man, there cannot be [4b]male and female; for you are all [5c]one [d]in Christ Jesus.',
'3:29': 'And if you are of [a]Christ, then you are [1]Abraham&rsquo;s [b]seed, [c]heirs according to [2d]promise.',
'4:1': 'But I say, As long as the [a]heir is a [1]child, he does not differ at all from a [b]slave, though he is lord of all;',
'4:2': 'But he is [a]under [1b]guardians and [c]stewards until the [2d]time appointed by the father.',
'4:3': 'So also we, when we were children, were kept in [a]slavery under the [1b]elements of the world;',
'4:4': 'But when the [1]fullness of the [a]time came, God [b]sent forth His [c]Son, born of a [2d]woman, born under [3e]law,',
'4:5': 'That He might [1a]redeem those under law that we might receive the [2b]sonship.',
'4:6': 'And because you are [a]sons, God has [b]sent forth the [1c]Spirit of His Son into our [2]hearts, [3]crying, [4d]Abba, Father!',
'4:7': 'So then you are [1]no longer a [a]slave but a son; and if a [2]son, an [3b]heir also [4]through God.',
'4:8': 'However at that time, [a]not knowing God, you were [b]slaves to the [c]gods which by [1]nature are not <I>gods</I>;',
'4:9': 'But now, having come to [a]know God, or rather having been [b]known by God, how is it that you turn again to the [c]weak and poor [d]elements, to which you desire to [1]be [e]enslaved yet again?',
'4:10': 'You observe [1a]days and [2]months and [3]seasons and [4]years;',
'4:11': 'I fear for you, [a]lest I have labored upon you in [1]vain.',
'4:12': 'Become [1]as I am, because I also am [2]as you are, brothers, I beseech you; you have [3]not wronged me at all.',
'4:13': 'And you know that [1]because of weakness of my flesh I [a]announced the gospel to you the first time.',
'4:14': 'And that which was a trial to you in my flesh you did not despise nor [1]loathe, but you [a]received me as an [b]angel of God, <I>indeed</I> as Christ Jesus.',
'4:15': 'Where then is [1]your felicitation? For I testify concerning you that if possible you would have plucked out your [2]eyes and given <I>them</I> to me.',
'4:16': 'So then have I become your enemy by presenting the [a]truth to you?',
'4:17': 'They are [1a]zealous of you, <I>but</I> [2]not rightly; but they desire to [3]shut you out that you may be [4]zealous of them.',
'4:18': 'But <I>it</I> <I>is</I> always good to be zealous in a good thing, and [1]not only [a]when I am present with you.',
'4:19': 'My [1a]children, with whom I [2b]travail again in birth until [3c]Christ is [4]formed [d]in you,',
'4:20': 'Indeed, I wish I could be present with you now and [1]change my [2]tone because I am [3]perplexed about you.',
'4:21': '[1]Tell me, you who desire to be [2a]under the law, do you not hear the [3]law?',
'4:22': 'For it is written that Abraham had two sons, [a]one of the [b]maidservant and [c]one of the [d]free woman.',
'4:23': 'However the one of the maidservant was born [1]according to the [a]flesh, but the one of the free woman <I>was</I> <I>born</I> [1]through [b]promise.',
'4:24': 'These things are spoken allegorically, for [1]these women are [2]two [a]covenants, one from [3b]Mount Sinai, bringing forth <I>children</I> unto [4c]slavery, which is [5d]Hagar.',
'4:25': 'Now this Hagar is Sinai the mountain in [a]Arabia and corresponds to the [1b]Jerusalem which now is, for she [2]is in [3c]slavery with her children.',
'4:26': 'But the [1a]Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother;',
'4:27': 'For it is written, [a]&ldquo;Rejoice, barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout, you who are not travailing, because [1]many are the children of her who is [2]desolate rather than of her who has her husband.&rdquo;',
'4:28': 'But you, brothers, in the way [a]Isaac was, are [1]children of [b]promise.',
'4:29': 'But just as at that time he who was born [1]according to the [a]flesh [2b]persecuted him <I>who</I> <I>was</I> <I>born</I> [1]according to the [3c]Spirit, [d]so [4]also <I>it</I> <I>is</I> now.',
'4:30': 'But what does the Scripture say? [a]&ldquo;Cast out the [b]maidservant and her son, for the [1]son of the maidservant shall by [c]no means inherit with the [2]son of the [d]free woman.&rdquo;',
'4:31': 'So then, brothers, we are [1]not children of the maidservant but [a]of the free woman.',
'5:1': 'It is for [1a]freedom <I>that</I> Christ has set us free; [2b]stand fast therefore, and do not be [3]entangled with a [4c]yoke of [d]slavery again.',
'5:2': 'Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become [1a]circumcised, Christ will profit you [2]nothing.',
'5:3': 'And I testify again to every man who becomes [a]circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.',
'5:4': 'You have been [1]brought to nought, <I>separated</I> from Christ, you who are being justified by [a]law; you have [2b]fallen from [c]grace.',
'5:5': 'For we [1a]by the Spirit [2b]out of faith [c]eagerly await the [3d]hope of [e]righteousness.',
'5:6': 'For [a]in Christ Jesus neither [b]circumcision [1]avails anything nor uncircumcision, but [c]faith <I>avails</I>, [2]operating through [3]love.',
'5:7': 'You were [a]running well. [b]Who hindered you that you would not believe and obey the [1c]truth?',
'5:8': 'This [1a]persuasion is not of Him who [b]calls you.',
'5:9': 'A little [1a]leaven leavens the [1]whole lump.',
'5:10': 'I am [a]confident in the Lord concerning you that you will be [b]of no other mind; but he who is [c]troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.',
'5:11': 'But I, brothers, if I still preach [1a]circumcision, why am I still being [b]persecuted? Then the [c]stumbling block of the [1]cross has been annulled.',
'5:12': 'I wish that those [a]upsetting you would even [1]cut themselves off.',
'5:13': 'For you were [a]called for [1b]freedom, brothers; only do not [c]<I>turn</I> this [d]freedom into an opportunity for the [2]flesh, but through [e]love [3f]serve one another.',
'5:14': 'For the whole [a]law is fulfilled in one word, in this, [b]&ldquo;You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;',
'5:15': 'But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another.',
'5:16': 'But I say, [1a]Walk [b]by the [2]Spirit and you shall by no means [c]fulfill the [d]lust of the [2]flesh.',
'5:17': 'For the [1]flesh lusts [a]against the [2]Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these [3]oppose each other that you would not do the things that you [b]desire.',
'5:18': 'But if you are [a]led by the [1]Spirit, you are [b]not under the [1]law.',
'5:19': 'And the [1]works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as [2]fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,',
'5:20': '[1]Idolatry, [a]sorcery, [2]enmities, [b]strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, [3]factions, [c]divisions, [4d]sects,',
'5:21': '[a]Envyings, [1]bouts of drunkenness, carousings, and things like these, of which I tell you beforehand, even as I have said before, that those who practice such things will [b]not [2]inherit the kingdom of God.',
'5:22': 'But the [1a]fruit of the Spirit is [b]love, [c]joy, [d]peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,',
'5:23': 'Meekness, [a]self-control; against such things there is [b]no law.',
'5:24': '[1]But they who are [a]of Christ Jesus [2]have [3b]crucified the [c]flesh with its passions and its lusts.',
'5:25': 'If we [1]live by the Spirit, let us also [2a]walk by the Spirit.',
'5:26': 'Let us [1]not become [a]vainglorious, provoking one another, [b]envying one another.',
'6:1': 'Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are [1a]spiritual [b]restore such a one in a [2c]spirit of [d]meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be [e]tempted.',
'6:2': 'Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the [1a]law of Christ completely.',
'6:3': 'For if anyone [1a]thinks he is something when he is nothing, he [b]deceives himself.',
'6:4': 'But let each man [a]prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another.',
'6:5': 'For each one shall bear his own load.',
'6:6': 'But let him who is instructed in the word [a]share in all [1]good things with him who instructs.',
'6:7': 'Do not be [1a]deceived: God is not [b]mocked; for whatever a man [c]sows, this he will also reap.',
'6:8': 'For he who sows [1]unto his own [2a]flesh will [b]reap [3c]corruption of the flesh, but he who [d]sows [1]unto the [2e]Spirit will [f]of the Spirit reap [3g]eternal life.',
'6:9': 'And let us [a]not lose heart in doing what is good, for in the proper season we will reap if we [1]do not [b]faint.',
'6:10': 'So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is [1a]good toward all, but especially toward those of the [2b]household of the [3c]faith.',
'6:11': 'See with what [1]large letters I have written to you with my [a]own hand.',
'6:12': 'As many as desire to make a [1]good show [2]in the flesh, these compel you to be [a]circumcised, <I>but</I> only that they may not be [b]persecuted for the [c]cross of Christ.',
'6:13': 'For neither do they that become circumcised [a]keep the law themselves, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast [b]in your flesh.',
'6:14': 'But far be it from me to [a]boast except in the [1b]cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through [2]whom the [3]world has been [c]crucified to me and I to the world.',
'6:15': 'For neither is [1a]circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a [1b]new creation <I>is</I> <I>what</I> <I>matters</I>.',
'6:16': 'And as many as [1]walk by this [2a]rule, [3b]peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the [4c]Israel of God.',
'6:17': 'Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the [1a]brands of Jesus.',
'6:18': 'The [1a]grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your [2]spirit, [3b]brothers. Amen.',

Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit ({1Co15:45|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45}; {2Co3:17|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17}), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds with the blessing of the land promised to Abraham.
