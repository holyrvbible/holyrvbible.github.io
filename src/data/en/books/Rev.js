'2:10': 'Do not [a]fear the things that you are about to [b]suffer. Behold, the [1c]devil is about to cast some of you into [d]prison that you may be [e]tried, and you will have [f]tribulation for [2g]ten days. Be [h]faithful [i]unto death, and I will give you the [3j]crown of life.',

'2:14': 'But I have a few things [a]against you, that you have some there who hold the [1b]teaching of [2c]Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat [3d]idol sacrifices and to commit [3e]fornication.',
'2:15': 'In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the [1a]teaching of the [2b]Nicolaitans.',

'2:17': 'He who has an [a]ear, let him hear what the [b]Spirit says to the churches. To him who [1c]overcomes, to him I will give of the [2d]hidden [e]manna, and to him I will give a white [3f]stone, and upon the stone a [4g]new name written, which [h]no one knows except him who receives <I>it</I>.',
'2:18': 'And to the messenger of the church in [1a]Thyatira write: These things says the [2b]Son of God, He who has [3c]eyes like a flame of fire, and His [d]feet are like shining bronze:',
'2:19': 'I [a]know your [1b]works and love and faith and service and your endurance and that your last works are more than the first.',
'2:20': 'But I have <I>something</I> [a]against you, that you tolerate the [1]woman [b]Jezebel, she who calls herself a [2]prophetess and [c]teaches and [3]leads My slaves astray to commit [4d]fornication and to eat [4e]idol sacrifices.',
'2:21': 'And I gave her time that she might [a]repent, and she is [b]not willing to repent of her fornication.',
'2:22': 'Behold, I cast her into a [1]bed, and those who commit [a]adultery with her, into [2]great tribulation, unless they repent of her works;',
'2:23': 'And her children I will [1]kill with death; and all the churches will know that I am He who [a]searches the [2]inward parts and the hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your [b]works.',
'2:24': 'But I say to you&mdash;the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this [a]teaching, who have not known the [1b]deep things of [c]Satan, as they say&mdash;I put no other burden upon you;',
'2:25': 'Nevertheless what you have [a]hold fast [1]until I [b]come.',
'2:26': 'And he who [1a]overcomes and he who keeps [2b]My works [c]until the end, to him I will give [3d]authority over the nations;',
'2:27': 'And he will [1]shepherd them with an [a]iron rod, as [b]vessels of pottery are broken in pieces, as [2c]I also have received from My Father;',

'3:2': 'Become [a]watchful and establish the [1]things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works [2b]completed before My God.',
'3:3': '[a]Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep <I>it</I> and [b]repent. If therefore you will not watch, I will [c]come as a [1d]thief, and you shall by no means know at what [e]hour I will come upon you.',
'3:4': 'But you have a few names in Sardis who have not [1a]defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in [2b]white because they are worthy.',
'3:5': 'He who [1a]overcomes will be [2]clothed thus, in [b]white garments, and I shall by no means [3c]erase his name out of the [4d]book of life, and I will [5e]confess his name before My Father and before His angels.',

'3:7': 'And to the messenger of the church in [1]Philadelphia write: These things says the [2a]Holy One, the [b]true One, the One who has the [3c]key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and no one opens:',
'3:8': 'I [a]know your works; behold, I have put before you an [1b]opened door which [c]no one can shut, because you have a [2]little power and have [d]kept My [3]word and have not [e]denied My [3]name.',
'3:9': 'Behold, I will make those of the [1a]synagogue of [b]Satan, those who call themselves [c]Jews and are [2]not, but lie&mdash;behold, I will cause them to come and [d]fall [3]prostrate before your feet and to know that I have [e]loved you.',
'3:10': 'Because you have [a]kept the [1]word of My [b]endurance, I also will [2c]keep you out of the hour of [d]trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who [e]dwell on the earth.',
'3:11': 'I [1a]come quickly; [b]hold fast what you have that no one take your [2c]crown.',
'3:12': 'He who [1a]overcomes, him I will make a [2b]pillar in the [c]temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the [3d]name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the [e]New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My [f]new name.',
'3:13': 'He who has an [a]ear, let him hear what the [b]Spirit says to the churches.',

'3:15': 'I [a]know your works, that you are neither cold nor [1]hot; I wish that you were cold or [1b]hot.',
'3:16': 'So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to [1]spew you out of My mouth.',
'3:17': 'Because you [1]say, I am [a]wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do not know that you are [2b]wretched and miserable and poor and [c]blind and [d]naked,',
'3:18': 'I counsel you to [1a]buy from Me [2b]gold [c]refined by [d]fire that you may be [e]rich, and [3f]white garments that you may be clothed and <I>that</I> the shame of your [g]nakedness may not be manifested, and [4]eyesalve to [h]anoint your eyes that you may see.',
'3:19': 'As many as I [a]love I reprove and [b]discipline; be [1]zealous therefore and [c]repent.',
'3:20': 'Behold, I stand at the [1a]door and [b]knock; if anyone [c]hears My [d]voice and [2]opens the door, then I will [e]come in to him and [3]dine with him and he with Me.',
'3:21': 'He who [1a]overcomes, to him I will give to [2]sit with Me on My [b]throne, as I also [c]overcame and [d]sat [e]with My Father on His throne.',
'3:22': 'He who has an [a]ear, let him hear what the [b]Spirit says to the [1]churches.',
'4:1': 'After these things I saw, and behold, a [a]door [1b]opened in heaven, and the first [2c]voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, [d]Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these [e]things.',
'4:2': 'Immediately I was in [1a]spirit; and behold, there was a [2b]throne set in heaven, and upon the throne <I>there</I> <I>was</I> [c]One sitting;',
'4:3': 'And He who was sitting was like a [1a]jasper stone and a [2b]sardius in appearance, and <I>there</I> <I>was</I> a [3c]rainbow around the throne like an [4d]emerald in appearance.',
'4:4': 'And [a]around the throne <I>there</I> <I>were</I> [1b]twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones [1c]twenty-four [2]elders sitting, clothed in [3d]white garments, and upon their heads golden [e]crowns.',
'4:5': 'And out of the throne come forth [a]lightnings and voices and thunders. And <I>there</I> <I>were</I> [1b]seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the [2c]seven Spirits of God;',
'4:6': 'And before the throne <I>there</I> <I>was</I> as it were a [1a]glassy sea like [b]crystal; and in the midst of the throne and around the throne, <I>there</I> <I>were</I> [2c]four living creatures [3d]full of eyes in front and behind.',
'4:7': 'And the first living creature was [1]like a [a]lion, and the second living creature like a [a]calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a [a]man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying [a]eagle.',
'4:8': 'And the four living creatures, each one of them having [a]six wings apiece, are full of eyes around and within; and they have no rest day and night, saying, [1b]Holy, holy, holy, [c]Lord God the Almighty, [2d]who was and who is and who is coming.',
'4:9': 'And when the <I>four</I> living creatures give [1a]glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits upon the throne, to Him who [b]lives forever and ever,',
'4:10': 'The twenty-four elders will [a]fall before Him who sits upon the throne and worship Him who lives forever and ever; and they will [1]cast their crowns before the throne, saying,',
'4:11': 'You are [a]worthy, our Lord and God, to receive the [1b]glory and the honor and the power, for You have [c]created all things, and because of Your [2d]will they were, and were created.',
'5:1': 'And I saw on the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne a [1a]scroll written within and on the back, sealed up with [2]seven seals.',
'5:2': 'And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is [a]worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?',
'5:3': 'And no one [a]in heaven nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it.',
'5:4': 'And I wept much because [1]no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it.',
'5:5': 'And one of the elders said to me, Do not weep; behold, the [1a]Lion of the tribe of [b]Judah, the [2c]Root of David, has [3d]overcome so that He may open the scroll and its seven seals.',
'5:6': 'And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a [1a]Lamb [2]standing as [3]having <I>just</I> been [b]slain, having [4]seven [c]horns and [5d]seven [e]eyes, [6]which are the [f]seven Spirits of God sent forth into [g]all the earth.',
'5:7': 'And He came and took <I>the</I> <I>scroll</I> out of the right hand of Him who sits upon the throne.',
'5:8': 'And when He took the scroll, the [a]four living creatures and the [b]twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a [c]harp and [d]golden [1]bowls full of [2e]incense, which <I>bowls</I> are the [f]prayers of the saints.',
'5:9': 'And they sing a [1a]new song, saying: You are [2b]worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, for You were [c]slain and have [d]purchased for God [3]by Your [e]blood <I>men</I> out of [f]every tribe and tongue and people and nation,',
'5:10': 'And have made [1]them a [2a]kingdom and priests to our God; and they will [b]reign [3]on the earth.',
'5:11': 'And I saw, and I heard the voice of [1]many angels around the throne and of the living creatures and of the elders, and their number was [a]ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands,',
'5:12': 'Saying with a loud voice, [a]Worthy is the [b]Lamb who has been [c]slain to receive the [d]power and [e]riches and wisdom and strength and honor and [f]glory and [g]blessing.',
'5:13': 'And [1]every creature which is [a]in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them, I heard saying, To Him who sits upon the throne and to the [b]Lamb be the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might forever and ever.',
'5:14': 'And the four living creatures said, [a]Amen. And the elders fell down and worshipped.',
'6:1': 'And I saw when the [a]Lamb [1]opened one of the [b]seven seals, and I heard one of the [c]four [2]living creatures saying like the [d]sound of thunder, [e]Come.',
'6:2': 'And I saw, and behold, a [1a]white horse, and [2]he who sits on it had a [3]bow; and a [4b]crown was given to him, and he [c]went forth [5d]conquering and to conquer.',
'6:3': 'And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come.',
'6:4': 'And [1]I saw, and behold, another horse, a [2a]red one, went forth; and to him who sits on it, to him <I>authority</I> was given to [3b]take peace from the earth, and that <I>men</I> should slay one another; and to him a great [c]sword was given.',
'6:5': 'And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come. And I saw, and behold, a [1a]black horse; and he who sits on it had a [2b]balance in his hand.',
'6:6': 'And I heard as it were a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying: A [1]choenix of wheat for a [2]denarius and three choenixes of barley for a [2]denarius; and do not harm the [3a]oil and the wine.',
'6:7': 'And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, Come.',
'6:8': 'And I saw, and behold, a [1]pale horse, and he who sits upon it, his name is [a]Death; and [2b]Hades followed with him. And authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth to [c]kill with the sword and with famine and with [3]death and by the [4]beasts of the earth.',
'6:9': 'And when He opened the [1]fifth seal, I saw [2]underneath the [a]altar the [b]souls of those who had been [c]slain because of the [d]word of God and because of the [e]testimony which they had.',
'6:10': 'And they [1]cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Master, [a]holy and true, will You not [b]judge and [c]avenge our blood on those who [d]dwell on the earth?',
'6:11': 'And to each of them was given a [1a]white robe; and it was said to them that they should [b]rest yet a little while, until also <I>the</I> <I>number</I> <I>of</I> their fellow slaves and their brothers who were [c]about to be [2]killed, even as they were, is completed.',
'6:12': 'And I saw when He opened the [1]sixth seal, and there was a great [2a]earthquake, and the [b]sun became black like [c]sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood;',
'6:13': 'And the [a]stars of heaven fell to the earth as a [b]fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.',
'6:14': 'And [a]heaven was removed like a scroll being rolled up, and every [b]mountain and island were moved out of their places.',
'6:15': 'And the [a]kings of the earth and the great men and the [1]generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man [b]hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains;',
'6:16': 'And they [1a]say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the [b]face of Him who sits upon the throne and from the [c]wrath of the [d]Lamb;',
'6:17': 'For the [a]great day of Their wrath has come, and [b]who is able to stand?',
'7:1': '[1]After this I saw four angels standing at the [a]four corners of the earth, holding the [b]four [2]winds of the earth, so that [3]no wind would blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree.',
'7:2': 'And I saw [1]another Angel ascending from the [a]rising of the sun, having the seal of the [b]living God; and He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom <I>authority</I> was given to harm the earth and the sea,',
'7:3': 'Saying, Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we [a]seal the slaves of our God upon [b]their foreheads.',
'7:4': 'And I heard the number of [1]those who were sealed, a [a]hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:',
'7:5': 'Out of the tribe of [1]Judah, twelve thousand sealed; out of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;',

'7:8': 'Out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand; out of the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand sealed.',
'7:9': 'After these things I saw, and behold, <I>there</I> <I>was</I> a [1]great multitude which no one could number, out of [a]every nation and <I>all</I> tribes and peoples and tongues, [2]standing before the throne and before the [b]Lamb, clothed in [3c]white robes and [4d]palm branches in their hands.',
'7:10': 'And they cry with a loud voice, saying, [1a]Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the [b]Lamb.',
'7:11': 'And all the angels stood around the throne and the [a]elders and the [b]four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God,',
'7:12': 'Saying, [1a]Amen. The [b]blessing and the [c]glory and the wisdom and the [d]thanks and the honor and the power and the strength be to our God forever and ever. Amen.',
'7:13': 'And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?',
'7:14': 'And I said to him, My lord, you know. And he said to me, These are those who come out of the [1]great [a]tribulation, and they have [b]washed their robes and made them [c]white in the [d]blood of the [e]Lamb.',
'7:15': 'Because of this [1]they are before the throne of God and [2a]serve Him day and night in His [b]temple; and He who sits upon the throne [3]will [c]tabernacle over them.',
'7:16': 'They will not [a]hunger any more, neither will they [b]thirst any more, neither will the [c]sun [1]beat upon them, nor any heat;',
'7:17': 'For the [a]Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will [1b]shepherd them and [c]guide them to [d]springs of [2e]waters of life; and God will [f]wipe away every [2]tear from their eyes.',
'8:1': 'And when He opened the seventh seal, there was [a]silence in [1]heaven for about half an hour.',
'8:2': 'And I saw the [a]seven angels who stand before God, and [1b]seven trumpets were given to them.',
'8:3': 'And [1a]another Angel came and stood at the [2b]altar, having a [3]golden [c]censer, and much [4d]incense was given to Him to [5]offer with the [e]prayers of all the [6]saints upon the [7f]golden altar which was before the throne.',
'8:4': 'And the [1a]smoke of the [2]incense went up with the [b]prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God.',
'8:5': 'And the Angel took the censer and [1]filled it with the [a]fire of the altar and [2b]cast <I>it</I> to the earth; and there were [c]thunders and voices and lightnings and an [d]earthquake.',
'8:6': 'And the [a]seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves [1]to trumpet.',
'8:7': 'And the first trumpeted, and there was [a]hail and [b]fire mingled with blood, and it was cast to the earth; and the [1c]third part of the [d]earth was burned up, and the third part of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.',
'8:8': 'And the second angel trumpeted, and as it were a great [a]mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the [1]sea became [b]blood,',
'8:9': 'And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea <I>and</I> had [1]life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed.',
'8:10': 'And the third angel trumpeted, and a great [a]star fell out of heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the [b]springs of waters.',
'8:11': 'And the name of the star is called [1]Wormwood; and the [2]third part of the waters became [a]wormwood, and many of the men died from the waters because they were made bitter.',
'8:12': 'And the [1]fourth angel trumpeted, and the [2]third part of the [a]sun and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars were smitten, so that the third part of them would be [b]darkened and the day would not appear for the third part of it, and the night likewise.',
'8:13': 'And I saw, and I heard an [a]eagle flying in [b]mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, [1c]Woe, woe, woe, to those who [d]dwell on the earth because of the remaining trumpet sounds of the [e]three angels who are about to trumpet!',
'9:1': 'And the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a [1a]star out of heaven [b]fallen to the earth, and to him was given the [c]key of the pit of the [2d]abyss.',
'9:2': 'And he opened the pit of the abyss, and [a]smoke went up out of the pit like the smoke of a great furnace; and the [b]sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit.',
'9:3': 'And out of the smoke came forth [1a]locusts to the earth, and to them [2]power was given, as the [b]scorpions of the earth have [2]power.',
'9:4': 'And it was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth or any green thing or any tree, but [1]men who do not have the [a]seal of God on their foreheads.',
'9:5': 'And it was given them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented [a]five months; and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.',
'9:6': 'And in those days men will [a]seek death and shall by no means find it; and they will long to die, and death flees from them.',
'9:7': 'And [1]the [2a]locusts were like horses prepared for [b]war, and on their heads <I>there</I> <I>were</I> as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were like faces of men.',
'9:8': 'And they had hair like the hair of women, and their [a]teeth were like <I>the</I> <I>teeth</I> of lions.',
'9:9': 'And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron; and the [a]sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots of many horses rushing into war.',
'9:10': 'And they have [a]tails like scorpions, and stings; and in their tails is their power to harm men for [b]five months.',
'9:11': 'They have a [a]king over them, the [1]angel of the [b]abyss; his name in Hebrew is [2]Abaddon; and in Greek he has the name [3]Apollyon.',
'9:12': 'The [1a]first woe has passed; behold, [2b]two woes are yet coming after these things.',
'9:13': 'And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice out of the four horns of the [1a]golden altar which is before God',
'9:14': 'Saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Release the four angels who are bound at the great river [a]Euphrates.',
'9:15': 'And the four angels were released, who had been prepared [1]for the hour and day and month and year that they might kill the [a]third part of men.',
'9:16': 'And the number of the armies of [1]horsemen was two hundred million; I heard their number.',
'9:17': 'And thus I saw the horses in the vision and those sitting on them, having breastplates of [a]fire and of hyacinth and of [b]brimstone; and the heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceed fire and [c]smoke and brimstone.',
'9:18': 'By these three [a]plagues the third part of the men were killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone proceeding out of their mouths.',
'9:19': 'For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their [a]tails; for their tails are like [1b]serpents and have heads, and with them they harm <I>men</I>.',
'9:20': 'And the rest of the men, who were not killed by these plagues, still did [a]not [1]repent of the [b]works of their hands, so as not to [c]worship the demons and the [d]idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can [2]neither see nor hear nor walk;',
'9:21': 'And they did [a]not repent of their murders or of their [b]sorceries or of their [c]fornication or of their thefts.',
'10:1': '[1]And I saw [2a]another strong Angel [b]coming down out of heaven, clothed with a [c]cloud; and the [3d]rainbow was upon His head, and His [e]face was like the [4]sun, and His [f]feet like [5]pillars of [6]fire;',
'10:2': 'And He had in His hand a [1]little opened [a]scroll. And He placed His [2]right foot on the sea and the left on the land;',
'10:3': 'And He cried out with a loud voice just as a [1a]lion [b]roars. And when He cried out, the [2]seven [c]thunders uttered their own voices.',
'10:4': 'And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, and I heard a [a]voice out of heaven saying, [b]Seal the things which the seven thunders spoke, and do not write them.',
'10:5': 'And the Angel whom I saw [a]standing on the sea and on the land [b]lifted up His right hand to heaven',
'10:6': 'And [1]swore by Him who [a]lives forever and ever, who [b]created heaven and the [2]things in it, and the earth and the [3]things in it, and the sea and the [4]things in it, that there shall be [5c]delay no longer,',
'10:7': 'But in the [1]days of the voice of the [a]seventh angel when he is about to trumpet, then the [2]mystery of God [3]is [4]finished, as He has [b]announced the [5]good news to His own slaves the prophets.',
'10:8': 'And the [a]voice which I heard out of heaven, I heard again speaking with me and saying, Go, take the opened [b]scroll in the hand of the Angel who is [c]standing on the sea and on the land.',
'10:9': 'And I went to the Angel and told Him to give me the little scroll. And He said to me, Take <I>it</I> and [a]devour it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as [b]sweet as honey.',
'10:10': 'And I took the little scroll out of the hand of the Angel and [1]devoured it, and it was as [2]sweet as honey in my mouth; and when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter.',
'10:11': 'And [1]they said to me, You must prophesy [2]again over many [a]peoples and nations and tongues and kings.',
'11:1': 'And there was given to me a [1a]reed like a [1]rod, <I>and</I> <I>someone</I> said, Rise and [2b]measure the [3c]temple of God and the [4d]altar and those who [e]worship in it.',
'11:2': 'And the [1a]court which is outside the [2]temple cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the [b]Gentiles, and they will trample the [3c]holy city for [4d]forty-two months.',
'11:3': 'And I will [1]cause My [2]two [a]witnesses to prophesy a [3b]thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in [4c]sackcloth.',
'11:4': 'These are the [a]two [1]olive trees and the two [2b]lampstands which stand before the [c]Lord of the earth.',
'11:5': 'And if anyone desires to harm them, [a]fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone desires to harm them, thus must he be killed.',
'11:6': 'These have the authority to [a]shut heaven that no [b]rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into [c]blood and to smite the earth with every [d]plague as often as they desire.',
'11:7': 'And when they have completed their [1a]testimony, the [2b]beast who comes up out of the [c]abyss will make [d]war with them and will overcome them and kill them.',
'11:8': 'And their corpses will be on the street of the [1]great [a]city, which spiritually is called [2b]Sodom and [c]Egypt, [d]where also their Lord was crucified.',
'11:9': 'And those of the [a]peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not allow their [b]corpses to be placed in a tomb.',
'11:10': 'And those who [a]dwell on the earth rejoice over them and make merry; and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.',
'11:11': 'And after the [1]three and a half days, the [2a]breath of life out of God entered into them, and they [3]stood on their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them.',
'11:12': 'And they heard a loud voice out of heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they [1a]went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them.',
'11:13': 'And in that hour there was a great [a]earthquake, and the tenth part of the [1b]city fell; and seven thousand [2]men were killed in the earthquake, and the rest became terrified and gave [c]glory to the [d]God of heaven.',
'11:14': 'The second [a]woe has passed; behold, the [1b]third woe is coming quickly.',
'11:15': 'And the [1a]seventh angel [2b]trumpeted; and there were loud [c]voices in heaven, saying, The [3d]kingdom of the world has become the [e]<I>kingdom</I> of our Lord and of [f]His Christ, and He will [4g]reign forever and ever.',
'11:16': 'And the [a]twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God,',
'11:17': 'Saying, We thank You, [a]Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great [b]power and have reigned.',
'11:18': 'And the [a]nations became angry, and Your [1b]wrath came, and the time came for the [2c]dead to be judged, and <I>the</I> <I>time</I> to give the [3d]reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who [4e]fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy [5]those who destroy the earth.',
'11:19': 'And the [1a]temple of God which is in heaven was opened, and the [b]Ark of His Covenant was seen in His [1]temple; and there were [c]lightnings and voices and thunders and an [2]earthquake and great [d]hail.',
'12:1': 'And a great [a]sign was seen in heaven: a [1b]woman clothed with the [c]sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars;',

'12:3': 'And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, <I>there</I> <I>was</I> a great red [1a]dragon, having [2b]seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads [3]seven [c]diadems.',
'12:4': 'And his tail drags away the third part of the [1a]stars of heaven, and he cast them to the earth. And the [2]dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might [b]devour her child.',
'12:5': 'And she [1]brought forth a son, a [2]man-child, who is to [a]shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was [3]caught up to God and to His throne.',
'12:6': 'And the woman fled into the [1]wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a [a]thousand two hundred and sixty days.',
'12:7': 'And there was [1]war in heaven: [2a]Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon warred and [3b]his angels.',
'12:8': 'And they did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven.',
'12:9': 'And the great dragon was [1]cast down, the [2]ancient [a]serpent, he who is called the [3b]Devil and [4c]Satan, he who [d]deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was [e]cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.',
'12:10': 'And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the [1a]kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the [2]accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who [b]accuses them before our God day and night.',
'12:11': 'And [1]they [a]overcame him because of the [2b]blood of the [c]Lamb and because of the [3]word of their testimony, and they [4d]loved not their soul-life even [5e]unto death.',

'17:3': 'And he [a]carried me away in [1b]spirit into a [2]wilderness; and I saw a [c]woman sitting upon a [3]scarlet [4d]beast, full of [e]names of [5]blasphemy, having [6f]seven heads and [g]ten horns.',
'17:4': 'And the woman was [a]clothed in [1]purple and [2]scarlet, and gilded with [3]gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a [4b]golden cup full of [c]abominations [5]and the [d]unclean things of her fornication.',
'17:5': 'And on her [a]forehead there was a name written, [1b]MYSTERY, [c]BABYLON THE GREAT, THE [2]MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE [3]ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.',
'17:6': 'And I saw the woman [1]drunk with the [a]blood of the saints and with the blood of the [2b]witnesses of Jesus. And I marveled <I>with</I> great marvel when I saw her.',
'17:7': 'And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the beast who bears her, who has the seven heads and the ten horns.',
'17:8': 'The [1]beast that you saw was and is not and is about to [a]come up out of the [b]abyss and [2]go into [c]perdition. And those who [d]dwell on the earth, <I>those</I> whose names are not [e]written from the foundation of the world in the [3f]book of life, will [g]marvel when they see the beast, that he was and is not and will be present.',
'17:9': 'Here is the mind which has [a]wisdom. The [b]seven heads are the [1]seven mountains where the woman sits',
'17:10': 'And are [1]seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain <I>only</I> a short time.',
'17:11': 'And the beast who was and is not, he himself is [1]also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition.',
'17:12': 'And the [a]ten horns which you saw are [1]ten kings, who have not yet received a [b]kingdom but receive authority as kings for [c]one hour with the beast.',
'17:13': 'These have one [1a]mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.',
'17:14': 'These will make [1a]war with the [b]Lamb, and the Lamb will [c]overcome them, for He is [d]Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are [e]with Him, the called and [2f]chosen and [g]faithful, <I>will</I> <I>also</I> <I>overcome</I> <I>them</I>.',
'17:15': 'And he said to me, The [1a]waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are [b]peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.',
'17:16': 'And the [a]ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will [1]hate the harlot and will make her [b]desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and [c]burn her utterly with fire.',
'17:17': 'For [1]God has put <I>it</I> into their hearts to perform His [2]mind and to perform one [a]mind and to give their [b]kingdom to the beast until the [c]words of God are accomplished.',
'17:18': 'And the [1]woman whom you saw is the [a]great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth.',
'18:1': 'After these things I saw [1a]another Angel [2]coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was [b]illumined with His glory.',
'18:2': 'And He cried with a strong voice, saying, [1a]Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great! And she has become a [b]dwelling place of demons and a [2]hold of every [c]unclean spirit and a [2]hold of every unclean and hateful bird;',
'18:3': 'For all the nations [1]have [2a]drunk of the wine of the fury of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have [b]committed fornication with her, and the [c]merchants of the earth have become [d]rich by the power of her [e]luxury.',
'18:4': 'And I heard another voice out of heaven, saying, [1a]Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins and that you do not receive her plagues;',
'18:5': 'For her sins have [1]accumulated up [a]to heaven, and God has [b]remembered her [2]unrighteousnesses.',
'18:6': '[a]Pay her back even as she has paid, and [1]double <I>to</I> <I>her</I> double according to her works; in the [b]cup which she has mixed, mix to her double.',
'18:7': 'As much as she has [a]glorified herself and lived [b]luxuriously, as much torment and sorrow give to her; for she says in her heart, I sit a [c]queen, and I am not a [d]widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow.',
'18:8': 'Therefore in [a]one day her plagues will come, death and sorrow and famine, and she will be utterly [1b]burned with fire; for the Lord God who [c]judges her is strong.',
'18:9': 'And the kings of the earth, who have [a]committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her, will [b]weep and lament over her when they see the [c]smoke of her burning,',
'18:10': '[a]Standing afar off because of fear of her torment, saying, [b]Woe, woe, the [c]great city, [d]Babylon, the strong city, for in [e]one hour your [f]judgment has come!',
'18:11': 'And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargo anymore:',
'18:12': '[1]Cargo of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet, and every <I>kind</I> of [2]thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood and brass and iron and marble,',
'18:13': 'And cinnamon and [1]amomum and incense and ointment and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep, and <I>cargo</I> of horses and chariots and [2a]slaves and [3b]souls of men.',
'18:14': 'And the ripe fruits of your soul&rsquo;s lust have gone away from you, and all the sumptuous and splendid things have perished from you; and <I>men</I> will find them no more at all.',
'18:15': 'The merchants of these things, who became rich by her, will stand afar off because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,',
'18:16': 'Saying, Woe, woe, the great city, which was [a]clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearl;',
'18:17': 'For in one hour such great wealth has become [a]desolate! And every ship captain and everyone sailing to a place and sailors and all who work on the sea stood afar off',
'18:18': 'And cried out, seeing the [a]smoke of her burning, saying, What <I>city</I> is like the great city?',
'18:19': 'And they cast dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying, Woe, woe, the great city, by which all those who have ships on the sea became rich from her [1]wealth, for in [2]one hour she has become desolate!',
'18:20': '[a]Be glad over her, O heaven and saints and [b]apostles and prophets, because God has [1]judged [c]judgment for you upon her.',
'18:21': 'And a strong angel took up a [a]stone like a great millstone and threw <I>it</I> into the sea, saying, Thus will Babylon, the great city, be [1]thrown down with violence and shall be found no more at all.',
'18:22': 'And the sound of [a]harp-singers and musicians and flutists and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in you, and no craftsman of any craft shall be found any more at all in you, and the [b]sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in you,',
'18:23': 'And the [a]light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in you, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall be heard no more at all in you; for your merchants were the [b]great ones of the earth, for by your [1c]sorcery all the nations were deceived.',
'18:24': 'And in her was found the [a]blood of prophets and of saints and of all who have been slain on the earth.',
'19:1': 'After these things I heard as it were a [a]loud voice of a [b]great multitude in heaven, saying, [1c]Hallelujah! The [d]salvation and the [e]glory and the power are of our God.',
'19:2': 'For [a]true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the [1b]great harlot who corrupted the earth with her [c]fornication, and He avenged the [d]blood of His slaves [2]at her hand.',
'19:3': 'And a second time they said, Hallelujah! And her [a]smoke goes up forever and ever.',
'19:4': 'And the [a]twenty-four elders and the [b]four living creatures [c]fell down and worshipped God, [d]who sits upon the throne, saying, [1e]Amen, Hallelujah!',
'19:5': 'And a [1a]voice came out from the throne, saying, [b]Praise our God, all His slaves and those who [c]fear Him, the small and the great.',
'19:6': 'And I heard as it were the [a]voice of a great multitude and like the sound of [1b]many waters and like the sound of [1]mighty [c]thunders, saying, Hallelujah! For the [d]Lord our God the Almighty [e]reigns.',
'19:7': 'Let us [a]rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the [1b]marriage of the Lamb has come, and His [2c]wife has made herself [d]ready.',
'19:8': 'And it was given to her that she should be [a]clothed in fine linen, bright <I>and</I> [1]clean; for the fine linen is the [2b]righteousnesses of the saints.',
'19:9': 'And he said to me, Write, [a]Blessed are they who are called to the [1b]marriage [2]dinner of the Lamb. And he said to me, These are the [c]true words of God.',
'19:10': 'And I [a]fell before his feet to worship him. And he said to me, Do not do this. I am your fellow slave and <I>a</I> <I>fellow</I> <I>slave</I> of your brothers who have the [b]testimony of Jesus. [c]Worship God. For the testimony of Jesus is the [1]spirit of the [d]prophecy.',

'19:20': 'And the beast was seized, and with him the [a]false prophet, who in his presence had done the [b]signs by which he deceived those who received the [c]mark of the beast and those who [d]worshipped his image. These two were [1e]cast alive into the [f]lake of fire, which burns with [g]brimstone.',
'19:21': 'And the rest were killed with the [a]sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse, and all the birds were filled with their flesh.',
'20:1': 'And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the [a]key of the [b]abyss and a great [c]chain in his hand.',
'20:2': 'And he laid hold of the [a]dragon, the ancient [b]serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and [1c]bound him for a thousand years',

First, in {Mat16:18|Matt. 16:18} the church is revealed as universal, and then in {Mat18:17|Matt. 18:17} it is revealed as local. In Acts the church was practiced in the way of local churches, such as the church in Jerusalem ({Act8:1|Acts 8:1}), the church in Antioch ({Act13:1|Acts 13:1}), the church in Ephesus ({Act20:17|Acts 20:17}), and the churches in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia ({Act15:41|Acts 15:41}). The Epistles were written to the local churches, except for a few written to individuals. Not one was written to the universal church. Without the local churches, the universal church has no practicality or actuality. The universal church is realized in the local churches. Knowing the church in its universal aspect must be consummated in knowing the church in its local aspect. It is a great advance for us to know and practice the local churches. Concerning the church, the book of Revelation is in the advanced stage. To know this book, we must advance from the understanding of the universal church to the realization and practice of the local churches, because this book is written to the local churches. Only those who are in the local churches are positioned rightly, with the right angle and the proper perspective, to see the visions in this book.","The Triune God is expressed in Christ ({Joh1:1|John 1:1}, {Joh1:14|14}; {1Ti3:16|1&nbsp;Tim. 3:16}; {Col2:9|Col. 2:9}); Christ is realized and experienced as the Spirit ({Joh14:16|John 14:16}-{Joh14:18|18}; {1Co15:45|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45}; {2Co3:17|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:17}; {Rom8:9|Rom. 8:9}; {Phi1:19|Phil. 1:19}) and is expressed in His Body, the universal church ({Eph1:22|Eph. 1:22}-{Eph1:23|23}; {1Co12:12|1&nbsp;Cor. 12:12}; {Eph4:4|Eph. 4:4}); and the universal church is expressed in the local churches. Therefore, to know and experience God, we need to know and experience Christ; to know and experience Christ, we need to participate in the universal church through the Spirit; and to participate in the universal church, we need to participate in the local churches."]},

In essence and existence, God&rsquo;s Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God&rsquo;s operation, God&rsquo;s Spirit is sevenfold. This is similar to the lampstand in {Zec4:2|Zech. 4:2}. In its existence it is one lampstand, but in its function it is seven lamps. At the time this book was written, the church had become degraded; the age was dark. Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God&rsquo;s move and work on the earth.","In {Mat28:19|Matt. 28:19} the sequence of the Triune God is: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Here the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking in {Rev2:7|2:7}, {Rev2:11|11}, {Rev2:17|17}, {Rev2:29|29}; {Rev3:6|3:6}, {Rev3:13|13}, {Rev3:22|22}; {Rev14:13|14:13}; {Rev22:17|22:17}.","At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned; from Them grace and peace are given to the receivers. Here, however, the Spirit is included; from Him grace and peace are imparted to the churches. This too indicates the crucial need of the Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church for God&rsquo;s move."]},

He did not realize the significance of the seven heavenly stars and the seven golden lampstands. Hence, the Lord unveiled the mystery to him, saying that &ldquo;the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.&rdquo; The significance of this not only was a mystery to John but also is a mystery to believers today. All believers need the unveiling of this mystery that they may see the churches and their messengers.","The churches, signified by the seven golden lampstands, are the testimony of Jesus (vv. {Rev1:2|2}, {Rev1:9|9}) in the divine nature, shining in the dark night locally yet collectively. The churches should be of the divine nature&mdash;golden. They should be the stands, even the lampstands, that bear the lamp with the oil (Christ as the life-giving Spirit) and shine in the darkness individually and collectively. They are individual lampstands locally, yet at the same time they are a group, a collection, of lampstands universally. They not only are shining locally but also are bearing universally the same testimony both to the localities and to the universe. They are of the same nature and in the same shape. They bear the same lamp for the same purpose and are fully identified with one another, not having any individual distinctiveness. The differences among the seven churches recorded in chs. {Rev2|2} and {Rev3|3} are all of a negative nature, not a positive one. Negatively, in their failures, the churches are different and separate from one another; but positively, in their nature, shape, and purpose, they are absolutely identical and are connected to one another.","It is easy for believers to see the universal church, but it is difficult for them to see the churches. The revelation of the local churches is the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate unveiling concerning the church, and it is recorded in the last book of the divine Word. To fully know the church, believers must follow the Lord from the Gospels through the Epistles to the book of Revelation until they are enabled to see the local churches as unveiled here. In Revelation the first vision is concerning the churches. The churches with Christ as their one center are the focus in the divine administration for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.","The messengers are the spiritual ones in the churches, the ones who bear the responsibility for the testimony of Jesus. They should be of the heavenly nature and should be in a heavenly position like stars. In the Acts and the Epistles the elders were the leading ones in the managing of the local churches ({Act14:23|Acts 14:23}; {Act20:17|20:17}; {Tit1:5|Titus 1:5}). The eldership is somewhat official, and at the time this book was written the offices in the churches had deteriorated because of the degradation of the church. In this book the Lord calls our attention back to the spiritual reality. Hence, this book emphasizes the messengers of the churches rather than the elders. The office of the elders is easily perceived, but the believers need to see the importance of the spiritual and heavenly reality of the messengers for the proper church life to bear the testimony of Jesus in the darkness of the church&rsquo;s degradation. In the first vision of this book, the vision concerning the churches, both Christ and the messengers of the churches are unveiled with the churches as never before, and this in a most particular way. For this the believers need to see a particular vision in their spirits."]},

The third epistle, to the church in Pergamos, pre-symbolizes the worldly church, the church married to the world, from the day Constantine accepted Christianity to the time the papal system was established in the latter part of the sixth century. The fourth epistle, to the church in Thyatira, depicts prophetically the apostate church, from the ordaining of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century to the end of this age, when Christ comes back. The fifth epistle, to the church in Sardis, prefigures the Protestant Church, from the Reformation in the early part of the sixteenth century to Christ&rsquo;s coming back. The sixth epistle, to the church in Philadelphia, predicts the church of brotherly love, the recovery of the proper church life, from the early part of the nineteenth century, when the brothers were raised up in England to practice the church outside all denominational and divisive systems, to the second appearing of the Lord.

Thus, it means conquering the common people, being victorious over the laity. Nicolaitans, then, must refer to a group of people who esteem themselves higher than common believers. This was undoubtedly the hierarchy adopted and established by Catholicism and Protestantism. The Lord hates the works, the behavior, of these Nicolaitans, and we must hate what the Lord hates.","God in His economy intended that all His people be priests serving Him directly. In {Exo19:6|Exo. 19:6}, God ordained the children of Israel to be a kingdom of priests. This means that God wanted them all to be priests. However, because they worshipped the golden calf ({Exo32:1|Exo. 32:1}-{Exo32:6|6}), they lost the priesthood, and only the tribe of Levi, because of its faithfulness to God, was chosen to replace the whole nation of Israel as priests to God ({Exo32:25|Exo. 32:25}-{Exo32:29|29}; {Deu33:8|Deut. 33:8}-{Deu33:10|10}). Hence, there was a mediatorial class between God and the children of Israel. This became a strong system in Judaism. In the New Testament, God has returned to His original intention according to His economy, in that He has made all believers in Christ priests ({Rev1:6|1:6}; {Rev5:10|5:10}; {1Pe2:5|1&nbsp;Pet. 2:5}, {1Pe2:9|9}). But at the end of the initial church, even in the first century, the Nicolaitans intervened as the mediatorial class to spoil God&rsquo;s economy. According to church history, this became a system that was adopted by the Roman Catholic Church and has been retained by the Protestant churches. Today in the Roman Catholic Church there is the priestly system, in the state churches there is the clerical system, and in the independent churches there is the pastoral system. All these are a mediatorial class, spoiling the universal priesthood of all believers. Thus, there are two distinct classes&mdash;the clergy and the laity. But in the proper church life there should be neither clergy nor laity; all believers should be priests of God. Because the mediatorial class destroys the universal priesthood in God&rsquo;s economy, the Lord hates it.","Among the seven serving ones in {Act6:5|Acts 6:5}, one was named Nikolaos (Gk.).

Even the words of the Scripture should not be considered merely as doctrines to teach our mind but as food to nourish our spirit ({Mat4:4|Matt. 4:4}; {Heb5:12|Heb. 5:12}-{Heb5:14|14}). Here in this epistle the Lord promised to give the overcomer to eat of the tree of life. This points back to {Gen2:8|Gen. 2:8}-{Gen2:9|9}, {Gen2:16|16}, which concerns the matter of eating ordained by God. In the epistle to the church in Pergamos, the Lord promised the overcomer that he would eat of the hidden manna ({Rev2:17|v. 17}), which refers to the eating of manna by the children of Israel in the wilderness ({Exo16:14|Exo. 16:14}-{Exo16:16|16}, {Exo16:31|31}). And in the epistle to the church in Laodicea, the Lord promised to dine with the one who opens the door to Him. To dine is to eat not merely one kind of food but the riches of a feast. This may refer to the eating of the rich produce of the good land of Canaan by the children of Israel ({Jos5:10|Josh. 5:10}-{Jos5:12|12}). This indicates that the Lord desires to recover the eating of the proper food by God&rsquo;s people, the food ordained by God and typified by the tree of life, the manna, and the produce of the good land, all of which are types of the various aspects of Christ as food to us. The degradation of the church distracts God&rsquo;s people from the eating of Christ as their food and turns them to the teaching of doctrines for knowledge. In the church&rsquo;s degradation there are the teaching of Balaam ({Rev2:14|v. 14}), the teaching of the Nicolaitans ({Rev2:15|v. 15}), the teaching by Jezebel ({Rev2:20|v. 20}), and the teaching of the deep things of Satan ({Rev2:24|v. 24}).

Because of the fall, the way to the tree of life was closed to man ({Gen3:22|Gen. 3:22}-{Gen3:24|24}). Through the redemption of Christ, the way by which man could touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, was opened again ({Heb10:19|Heb. 10:19}-{Heb10:20|20}). But in the church&rsquo;s degradation, religion crept in with its knowledge to distract the believers in Christ from eating Him as the tree of life. Hence, the Lord promised to grant the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life in the Paradise of God, as a reward. This is an incentive for them to leave religion with its knowledge and return to the enjoyment of Himself. This promise of the Lord restores the church to God&rsquo;s original intention according to His economy.

Because of religion&rsquo;s distraction and the church&rsquo;s degradation, the Lord in His wisdom made the enjoyment of Himself in the coming kingdom a reward in order to encourage His believers to overcome religion&rsquo;s distracting knowledge in teachings and return to the enjoyment of Himself as the life supply in the church life today for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s economy.","Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life. The content of the church life depends on the enjoyment of Christ. The more we enjoy Him, the richer the content will be. But to enjoy Christ requires us to love Him with the first love. If we leave our first love toward the Lord, we will miss the enjoyment of Christ and lose the testimony of Jesus; consequently, the lampstand will be removed from us.

Apparently, those in the synagogues were worshipping God; actually, they were opposing God. They persecuted and killed God&rsquo;s true worshippers, yet they considered that they were offering service to God ({Joh16:2|John 16:2}). Through all the centuries since then, religious people have followed in their steps, persecuting those who genuinely seek and follow the Lord in spirit and life, while still considering that they are defending the interests of God.

The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them. The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book ({Luk10:20|Luke 10:20}). These blessings are in three stages: (1) in the church, (2) in the millennial kingdom, and (3) in eternity. The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, the divine nature, etc., are the initial portions. All God&rsquo;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life. If they cooperate with God&rsquo;s supplying grace, they will mature in life in the church age, and this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize with which the Lord will reward them at His coming back. That prize will be the entrance into the millennial kingdom and participation in the divine blessings in that stage, such as the joy and rest of the Lord ({Mat25:21|Matt. 25:21}, {Mat25:23|23}; {Heb4:9|Heb. 4:9}-{Heb4:11|11}), the reign over the nations ({Rev2:26|2:26}-{Rev2:27|27}; {Rev20:4|20:4}, {Rev20:6|6}), etc., which God has prepared as an incentive for His chosen ones to go on with Him in the church age. However, many of His chosen ones, after receiving His forgiveness, redemption, eternal life, divine nature, etc., will not cooperate with His grace and will not go on with Him. Hence, they are unable to mature in life in the church age and thus will not be ready at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to enter into the millennial kingdom and share in the divine blessings of that age as a prize. Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life. After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, they will share in the divine blessings in the stage of eternity, such as the eternal priesthood with God&rsquo;s eternal presence, the eternal kingship ({Rev22:3|22:3}-{Rev22:5|5}), the New Jerusalem, the tree of life ({Rev22:14|22:14}), the water of life ({Rev22:17|22:17}), etc. At that time their names should again be written in the book of life. This means that all God&rsquo;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life and who have been brought into the participation of the divine blessings in the stage of the church &ldquo;shall by no means perish forever&rdquo; ({Joh10:28|John 10:28}); that is, they shall by no means lose the divine blessings of eternity.
