verses: {
'1:1': 'The word of Jehovah which came to [1a]Micah the Morashtite in the days of [b]Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.',
'1:2': '[1a]Hear, all you peoples,<br>And give heed, O earth and its fullness;<br>And let the Lord Jehovah be a witness against you,<br>The Lord from His holy [b]temple.',
'1:3': 'For Jehovah is about to come forth from His [a]place,<br>And He will come down and tread upon the [b]high places of the earth.',
'1:4': 'And the mountains will be [a]melted under Him,<br>And the valleys will be cleft,<br>Like wax before fire,<br>Like water poured down a slope.',
'1:5': 'All this is because of the transgression of Jacob<br>And because of the sins of the house of Israel.<br>What is the transgression of Jacob?<br>Is it not Samaria?<br>And what are the high places of Judah?<br>Are they not Jerusalem?',
'1:6': 'Therefore I will make Samaria<br>A [a]heap of ruins in a field,<br>Places for the planting of vineyards;<br>And I will pour her stones down into the valley<br>And uncover her foundations.',
'1:7': 'And all her engraved idols will be smashed,<br>And all her gifts for harlotry will be burned with fire,<br>And all her images I will make a desolation;<br>For from the harlot&rsquo;s hire she has gathered them,<br>And unto the harlot&rsquo;s hire they will return.',
'1:8': 'Because of this I will wail and howl;<br>I will go about [a]barefoot and naked.<br>I will make a wailing like the jackals<br>And a lamentation like the ostriches.',
'1:9': 'For her [a]wound is incurable,<br>For it has come as far as Judah;<br>It reaches as far as the gate of my people,<br>As far as Jerusalem.',
'1:10': '[a]Do not declare it in Gath;<br>Do not weep at all.<br>In Beth-le-aphrah<br>I rolled myself in the dust.',
'1:11': 'Pass away on your own,<br>O inhabitress of Shaphir,<br>In shameful nakedness;<br>The inhabitress of Zaanan<br>Has not gone forth;<br>There is lamentation in Beth-ezel;<br>It will take from you its support.',
'1:12': 'For the inhabitress of Maroth<br>Waits in pain for good,<br>For evil has come down from Jehovah<br>To the gate of Jerusalem.',
'1:13': 'Bind the chariot to the steeds, O inhabitress of [a]Lachish.<br>She was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion,<br>For the transgressions of Israel were found in you.',
'1:14': 'Therefore you will give a parting gift<br>To Moresheth-gath:<br>The houses of Achzib will be a deception<br>To the kings of Israel.',
'1:15': 'Further, I will bring upon you the possessor,<br>O inhabitress of Mareshah;<br>The glory of Israel will come<br>As far as Adullam.',
'1:16': 'Shave yourself and cut off your hair<br>For the children of your delights;<br>Enlarge your baldness like an eagle,<br>For they have gone from you into [a]captivity.',
'2:1': 'Woe to those who devise wickedness<br>And who prepare evil upon their beds!<br>In the light of the morning they do it<br>Because [1]it is in the power of their hand to do so.',
'2:2': 'And they covet fields and seize them,<br>And houses, and take them away;<br>And they oppress a person and his house,<br>And a man and his inheritance.',
'2:3': 'Therefore thus says Jehovah,<br>I am now devising evil against this [a]family,<br>From which you will not remove your necks;<br>And you will not go about haughtily,<br>For it is an evil time.',
'2:4': 'In that day they will take up a proverb concerning you,<br>And they will lament a lamenting lament; they will say,<br>We are utterly ruined;<br>He has changed the portion of my people.<br>How He removes it from me!<br>He has apportioned our fields to the rebellious.',
'2:5': 'Therefore you will have no one who casts the line by lot<br>In the congregation of Jehovah.',
'2:6': '[a]Do not prophesy, they prophesy.<br>If the true prophets do not prophesy concerning these things,<br>The reproaches will not be turned back.',
'2:7': 'Will it be said, O house of Jacob,<br>Is the Spirit of Jehovah [1]hasty?<br>Are these His doings?<br>Do not My words benefit<br>Him who walks uprightly?',
'2:8': 'But recently My people<br>Have risen up as an enemy;<br>You strip away the mantle<br>From off the garment<br>Of those who pass by securely,<br>Those who turn away from conflict.',
'2:9': 'The women of My people you cast out,<br>From their pleasant houses;<br>From their young children you take away<br>My splendor forever.',
'2:10': 'Arise and go,<br>For this is not your resting place,<br>Because of the uncleanness<br>That brings destruction, indeed grievous destruction.',
'2:11': 'If a man going about<br>After wind and falsehood lies, saying,<br>I will [a]prophesy to you<br>Concerning wine and liquor;<br>He would indeed become a prophet of this people.',
'2:12': 'I will surely [1]gather all of you, O Jacob;<br>I will surely assemble the [a]remnant of Israel.<br>I will place them together like the [b]sheep of Bozrah,<br>Like the flock in the midst of its pasture;<br>They will make much noise because of the many men.',
'2:13': 'He who breaks through goes up before them;<br>They break through and pass through the gate,<br>And they go forth through it.<br>And their King goes forth before them;<br>Indeed [a]Jehovah is at their head.',
'3:1': 'And I said,<br>Hear now, you heads of Jacob<br>And you rulers of the house of Israel:<br>Is it not for you<br>To know justice?',
'3:2': 'You who hate good<br>And love evil,<br>You who tear away their skin from off them<br>And their flesh from off their bones,',
'3:3': 'And who devour the flesh of My people<br>And strip off their skin from off them<br>And break their bones in pieces<br>And chop them as for the pot<br>And like meat in a cauldron.',
'3:4': 'Then they will cry out to Jehovah,<br>But He will not answer them;<br>Indeed He will [a]hide His face from them at that time,<br>Just as they were evil in their doings.',
'3:5': 'Thus says Jehovah concerning the [a]prophets<br>Who cause My people to err,<br>Who, when they have something to bite with their teeth,<br>Cry, Peace,<br>But if there is one who does not give something for their mouths,<br>They prepare for war against him.',
'3:6': 'Therefore there will be night to you, without vision,<br>And darkness to you, without divination.<br>And the sun will go down on the prophets,<br>And the day will be black over them.',
'3:7': 'And the seers will be put to shame,<br>And the diviners will be ashamed;<br>And they will all cover their mouths,<br>For there will be [a]no answer from God.',
'3:8': 'But as for me, I am [a]full<br>Of power, with the Spirit of Jehovah, and of justice and might,<br>To declare to Jacob his transgression<br>And to Israel his sin.',
'3:9': 'Hear now this, you heads of the house of Jacob<br>And you rulers of the house of Israel:<br>You who abhor justice<br>And pervert all uprightness,',
'3:10': '[a]Who build Zion by bloodshed<br>And Jerusalem by iniquity.',
'3:11': 'Her leaders judge for a bribe,<br>And her priests teach for hire,<br>And her prophets divine for money;<br>But they lean on Jehovah, saying,<br>Is not Jehovah in our midst?<br>Evil will not come upon us.',
'3:12': 'Therefore on account of you<br>[a]Zion will be plowed as a field,<br>And Jerusalem will become a heap of ruins,<br>And the [b]mountain of the house will become the high places of a forest.',
'4:1': '[1a]But in the last days<br>The [b]mountain of the house of Jehovah<br>Will be established on the top of the mountains;<br>And it will be lifted up above the hills;<br>And the peoples will stream to it.',
'4:2': 'And many nations will come and say,<br>Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah<br>And to the house of the God of Jacob;<br>That He may instruct us in His ways,<br>And that we may walk in His paths;<br>For from Zion will go forth instruction,<br>And the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.',
'4:3': 'And He will judge between many peoples<br>And will decide matters for numerous nations from afar.<br>And they will [a]beat their swords into plowshares<br>And their spears into pruning knives;<br>Nation will not lift up sword against nation,<br>Nor will they learn [b]war anymore.',
'4:4': 'And they will each sit underneath his [a]vine<br>And underneath his fig tree,<br>And no one will disturb them;<br>For the mouth of Jehovah of hosts has spoken.',
'4:5': 'For all the peoples will walk,<br>Each in the name of his god;<br>But we will [a]walk<br>In the name of Jehovah our God<br>Forever and ever.',
'4:6': 'In that day,<br>Declares Jehovah,<br>I will gather her that limps,<br>And her that has been driven out I will collect,<br>As well as her that I have afflicted;',
'4:7': 'And I will make her that limps a [a]remnant,<br>And her that has been cast far away a mighty nation;<br>And Jehovah will [b]reign over them in Mount Zion<br>From then on, and even forever.',
'4:8': 'And you, O tower of the flock,<br>O hill of the daughter of Zion,<br>To you will it come,<br>Indeed the first dominion will come,<br>The kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.',
'4:9': 'Why do you now cry out aloud?<br>Is there no king among you?<br>Has your counselor perished,<br>That pain has seized you like a [a]woman delivering a child?',
'4:10': 'Suffer the pain and thrust forth,<br>O daughter of Zion, like a woman delivering a child.<br>For now you will go forth from the city<br>And dwell in the field;<br>And you will go into Babylon.<br>And there you will be delivered;<br>There Jehovah will redeem you<br>From the hand of your enemies.',
'4:11': 'And now many nations<br>Are [a]gathered against you,<br>They who say, Let her be profaned,<br>And let our eyes gaze on Zion.',
'4:12': 'But they do not know<br>The [a]thoughts of Jehovah,<br>And they do not understand His counsel;<br>For He has gathered them like sheaves for the [b]threshing floor.',
'4:13': 'Arise and [a]thresh, O daughter of Zion;<br>For I will make your horn iron,<br>And I will make your hooves bronze;<br>And you will [b]crush many peoples to powder.<br>And I will devote their profit to Jehovah,<br>And their substance to the [c]Lord of the whole earth.',
'5:1': 'Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops;<br>He has laid a siege against us.<br>With a rod they strike on the [a]cheek<br>The Judge of Israel.',
'5:2': '(But you, O [a]Bethlehem Ephrathah,<br>So little to be among the thousands of Judah,<br>From you there will [1b]come forth to Me<br>He who is to be [2]Ruler in Israel;<br>And His [1]goings forth are from [c]ancient times,<br>From the days of eternity.)',
'5:3': 'Therefore He will give them up until the time<br>When she who is in labor delivers the child;<br>Then the remainder of His brothers will return,<br>Along with the children of Israel.',
'5:4': 'And He will stand and [a]feed His flock in the strength of Jehovah,<br>In the majesty of the name of Jehovah His God;<br>And they will abide, for now He will be great<br>Unto the ends of the earth.',
'5:5': 'And this One will be the [a]peace.<br>When Assyria comes into our land<br>And when he treads in our palaces,<br>We will raise up against him seven shepherds<br>And eight princes of men.',
'5:6': 'And they will waste the land of Assyria with the sword<br>And the land of [a]Nimrod at its entrances.<br>And [1]He will save us from Assyria,<br>When he comes into our land<br>And when he treads in our border.',
'5:7': 'And the [1a]remnant of Jacob will be<br>In the midst of many peoples<br>Like [b]dew from Jehovah,<br>Like abundant showers upon the herbage,<br>Which do not tarry for man<br>And do not wait for the sons of men.',
'5:8': 'And the remnant of Jacob will be among the nations,<br>In the midst of many peoples,<br>Like a [a]lion among the beasts of the forest,<br>Like a young lion among the flocks of sheep,<br>Who, if he should pass through, tramples under<br>And tears up, and there is none to deliver from him.',
'5:9': 'Your hand will be raised up against your adversaries,<br>And all your enemies will be cut off.',
'5:10': 'In that [1]day,<br>Declares Jehovah,<br>I will cut off your horses from the midst of you<br>And will destroy your chariots.',
'5:11': 'And I will cut off the cities of your land<br>And will throw down all your strongholds.',
'5:12': 'And I will cut off the sorceries from your hand,<br>And you will not have soothsayers.',
'5:13': 'And I will cut off your idols<br>And your pillars from your midst;<br>And you will no longer worship<br>The [a]work of your hands.',
'5:14': 'And I will pluck up your Asherahs from your midst,<br>And I will destroy your cities.',
'5:15': 'And I will execute [a]vengeance in anger and wrath<br>Upon the nations that have not listened.',
'6:1': 'Hear now what Jehovah says:<br>Arise, contend before the mountains,<br>And let the hills hear your voice.',
'6:2': 'Hear, O mountains, Jehovah&rsquo;s contention,<br>And you enduring foundations of the earth;<br>For Jehovah has a [a]contention with His people,<br>And with Israel He will dispute.',
'6:3': 'O My people, what have I done to You?<br>And with what have I wearied you? Testify against Me.',
'6:4': 'For I [a]brought you up out of the land of Egypt,<br>And from the slave house I redeemed you;<br>And I sent before you Moses,<br>Aaron, and [b]Miriam.',
'6:5': 'O My people, remember now what Balak the king of Moab counseled,<br>And what [a]Balaam the son of Beor answered him,<br>From [b]Shittim to Gilgal,<br>That you may know the righteous acts of Jehovah.',
'6:6': 'With what shall I come before Jehovah<br>And bow myself before the high God?<br>Shall I come before Him with burnt offerings,<br>With one-year-old calves?',
'6:7': 'Will Jehovah be [a]pleased with thousands of rams,<br>With tens of thousands of rivers of oil?<br>Shall I give my [1]firstborn for my transgression,<br>The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?',
'6:8': 'He has declared to you, O man, what is good;<br>And what does Jehovah require of you,<br>[1]But that you would execute [a]justice and love mercy<br>And walk humbly with your God?',
'6:9': 'The voice of Jehovah cries out to the city,<br>And wisdom looks upon Your name.<br>Hear the rod and Him who appointed it.',
'6:10': 'Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked,<br>And a scant measure that is abominable?',
'6:11': 'Shall I be pure with wicked balances<br>And with a bag of deceitful weights?',
'6:12': 'For the rich men of [1]the city are full of violence,<br>And those who inhabit it speak falsehood,<br>And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.',
'6:13': 'Thus I also have made you sick by striking you;<br>I have made you desolate because of your sins.',
'6:14': 'You will eat, but you will not be satisfied;<br>And your emptiness will remain in the midst of you;<br>And you will take away,<br>But you will not rescue,<br>And what you rescue I will give up to the sword.',
'6:15': 'You will [a]sow,<br>But you will not reap;<br>You will tread olives,<br>But you will not anoint yourself with oil,<br>And the new wine,<br>But you will not drink wine.',
'6:16': 'For the statutes of [a]Omri are kept,<br>And all the works of the house of [b]Ahab;<br>And you walk in their counsels,<br>That I may make you a desolation,<br>And the inhabitants of the city a hissing;<br>And you will bear the reproach of My people.',
'7:1': 'Woe is me! For I am like a gathering of summer fruit<br>And like a [a]gleaning of the vintage;<br>There is no cluster to eat,<br>Nor first-ripe fig, which my soul desires.',
'7:2': 'The godly man has perished from the land,<br>And there is none upright among men;<br>They all lie in wait for bloodshed;<br>They each hunt their brother with a net.',
'7:3': 'Both hands are set upon evil, to do it well:<br>The prince asks for it,<br>And the judge agrees, for a reward,<br>And the great man, he utters the evil desire of his soul,<br>And they weave it together.',
'7:4': 'The best one among them is like a [a]briar;<br>The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge.<br>The day of your watchmen, your visitation, has come;<br>Now will be their confounding.',
'7:5': 'Do not trust in a neighbor;<br>Do not put your confidence in a friend;<br>Keep the doors of your mouth<br>From her who lies in your bosom.',
'7:6': 'For the son treats the [a]father like a fool;<br>The daughter rises up against her mother,<br>The daughter-in-law, against her mother-in-law;<br>A man&rsquo;s enemies are the men of his own house.',
'7:7': 'But as for me, I will [a]look for Jehovah;<br>I will wait for the God of my salvation;<br>My God will hear me.',
'7:8': 'Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy;<br>When I [a]fall, I will rise up;<br>When I sit in the darkness,<br>Jehovah will be a light to me.',
'7:9': 'I will bear the indignation of Jehovah&mdash;<br>For I have sinned against Him&mdash;<br>Until He plead my cause<br>And execute justice for me;<br>He will bring me forth into the light;<br>I will see His righteousness.',
'7:10': 'Then my enemy will see<br>And shame will cover<br>Her who said to me,<br>Where is Jehovah your God?<br>My eyes will see her:<br>At that time she will become trampled<br>Like mud in the streets.',
'7:11': 'A day for building your walls!<br>In that day the decree will be far away;',
'7:12': 'In that day they will come even unto you<br>From [a]Assyria and from the cities of Egypt,<br>And from Egypt even to the [1]River,<br>And from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.',
'7:13': 'But the land will become desolate<br>Because of the inhabitants in it, due to the fruit of their doings.',
'7:14': '[a]Shepherd Your people with Your rod,<br>The flock of Your inheritance,<br>Who dwell alone in the forest<br>In the midst of Carmel;<br>Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead<br>As in the days of old.',
'7:15': 'As in the days of your [a]going forth out from the land of Egypt,<br>I will show [1]you wonders.',
'7:16': 'The nations will see and be ashamed<br>Of all their might;<br>They will put the hand over the mouth;<br>Their ears will be deaf.',
'7:17': 'They will [a]lick the dust like a serpent;<br>Like crawling things of the earth,<br>They will come quivering from their enclosed places;<br>To Jehovah our God<br>They will turn in fear and be afraid because of You.',
'7:18': '[a]Who is a God like You,<br>[1b]Pardoning iniquity<br>And passing over the transgression<br>Of the [c]remnant of His inheritance?<br>He does not retain His anger forever,<br>For He delights in lovingkindness.',
'7:19': 'He will again have compassion on us;<br>He will tread our iniquities underfoot.<br>And You will [a]cast into the depths of the sea<br>All their sins.',
'7:20': 'You will perform truth to Jacob,<br>And lovingkindness to Abraham,<br>Which You have sworn to our fathers<br>From the days of old.',

Although Christ came forth from Bethlehem, His goings forth were from ancient times, from the days of eternity. This refers to Christ&rsquo;s eternal origin and indicates that in eternity, before the creation of the earth, Christ was preparing to come forth. Christ&rsquo;s appearing, His manifestation, began in eternity. From ancient times, from the days of eternity, the Triune God was preparing to come forth out of eternity into time, to come with His divinity into humanity by being born in Bethlehem as a man. His creating of all things was His preparation for Him to come out of eternity into time. This was the purpose of creation. Then, while the &ldquo;locusts&rdquo; were operating to consume Israel ({Joe1:4|Joel 1:4}; {Joe2:25|2:25}), Christ came forth.","Christ&rsquo;s going forth, His appearing, is a continuous matter. At the time of His incarnation He began to come forth. After His incarnation, He continued to go forth through His human living, His death, His resurrection, His ascension, His outpouring of the consummated Spirit (who is the reality of Christ Himself), and His spreading through the preaching of the gospel to the whole inhabited earth. All these are great steps in Christ&rsquo;s going forth. His going forth has not ceased but is continuing today. Christ&rsquo;s going forth, His manifestation, will consummate when He comes back with the overcomers as the mighty ones ({Joe3:11|Joel 3:11}) to defeat Antichrist and cast him into the lake of fire ({Rev19:19|Rev. 19:19}-{Rev19:20|20}), when Satan is cast into the abyss ({Rev20:2|Rev. 20:2}-{Rev20:3|3}), and when Christ sets up His throne to reign as King ({Mat25:31|Matt. 25:31}, {Mat25:34|34}, {Mat25:40|40}). At that time His appearing will be complete.","While Christ is on the way, He is taking care of the scattered Jews. On the one hand, Israel is under God&rsquo;s chastisement; on the other hand, Israel is also under God&rsquo;s shepherding care. This shepherding is God&rsquo;s preservation of Israel."]},

Human government that was formed in opposition to God began with Nimrod, the first type of Antichrist and the founder of Nineveh (the capital of Assyria) and Babel, which issued in Babylon ({Gen10:8|Gen. 10:8}-{Gen10:11|11} and {Gen10:8^1|note 8<sup>1</sup>}). Throughout the centuries human government, including the empires of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, has been used by God to carry out His work of chastising Israel. Eventually, the entire human government&mdash;the four kinds of locusts mentioned in {Joe1|Joel 1} and the four sections of the great human image described in {Dan2|Dan. 2}&mdash;will be smashed by a single stone, Christ as the stone cut out without hands that will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth ({Dan2:34|Dan. 2:34}-{Dan2:35|35} and {Dan2:34^1|notes}). It is in this way that Christ will save Israel from Assyria.","In relation to Christ&rsquo;s coming and the restoration of Israel, Assyria equals Rome, and Nimrod equals Antichrist. Eventually, Israel will be invaded by Antichrist, the last Caesar of the Roman Empire, and his armies. At this juncture Christ will come to destroy Antichrist and his armies and to save Israel ({Zec14:2|Zech. 14:2}-{Zec14:7|7}; {Rev19:19|Rev. 19:19}-{Rev19:21|21}).
