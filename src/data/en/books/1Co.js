'1:1': 'Paul, a [1a]called apostle of Christ Jesus through the [2b]will of God, and [3]Sosthenes the brother,',
'1:2': 'To the [1a]church of God which is [2]in [b]Corinth, [3]to those who have been [4c]sanctified [5]in Christ Jesus, the [6d]called saints, [7]with all those who [8e]call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, <I>who</I> <I>is</I> [9f]theirs and ours:',
'1:3': '[a]Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.',
'1:4': 'I [a]thank my God always concerning you [1]based upon the [b]grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,',
'1:5': 'That in everything you were [a]enriched in Him, in all [1]utterance and all [b]knowledge,',
'1:6': 'Even as the [1a]testimony of Christ was confirmed [2]in you,',
'1:7': 'So that you do not lack in any [1a]gift, eagerly awaiting the [2b]revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,',
'1:8': '[1]Who will also [2a]confirm you until the end [b]unreprovable in the [3c]day of our Lord Jesus Christ.',
'1:9': '[1]God is [a]faithful, through whom you were [b]called [2]into the [c]fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.',
'1:10': 'Now I beseech you, brothers, through the [1a]name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all [2b]speak the same thing and <I>that</I> there be no [3c]divisions among you, but <I>that</I> you be [4]attuned in the [d]same mind and in the same [5e]opinion.',
'1:11': 'For it has been made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of <I>the</I> <I>household</I> <I>of</I> [1]Chloe, that there are [a]strifes among you.',
'1:12': 'Now I mean this, that each of you says, [1a]I am of [b]Paul, and I of [c]Apollos, and I of [d]Cephas, and I of [2]Christ.',
'1:13': 'Is [1]Christ [a]divided? Was Paul [2]crucified for you? Or were you [b]baptized into the name of Paul?',
'1:14': 'I thank God that I baptized none of you except [a]Crispus and [b]Gaius,',
'1:15': 'That no one may say that you were baptized into my name.',
'1:16': 'And I did baptize the household of [a]Stephanas also; beyond that I do not know if I baptized any other.',
'1:17': 'For Christ did not [1]send me to baptize but to announce the gospel, not in [2a]wisdom of speech that the [3b]cross of Christ may not be made void.',
'1:18': 'For the [1a]word of the cross is to those who are [b]perishing [c]foolishness, but to us who are being [d]saved it is the [e]power of God.',
'1:19': 'For it is written, [a]&ldquo;I will destroy the wisdom of the [1b]wise, and the understanding of those who understand I will set aside.&rdquo;',
'1:20': 'Where is the [a]wise? Where is the [1b]scribe? Where is the disputer of [c]this age? Has not God made the wisdom of the world [d]foolish?',
'1:21': 'For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know God, God [1]was well pleased through the [a]foolishness of the [2]preaching to [b]save those who believe.',
'1:22': 'For indeed Jews require [1a]signs and Greeks seek wisdom,',
'1:23': 'But we [a]preach [1]Christ [b]crucified, to Jews a [c]stumbling block, and to Gentiles [d]foolishness,',
'1:24': 'But to [1]those who are [a]called, both [b]Jews and Greeks, Christ the [2c]power of God and the [d]wisdom of God.',
'1:25': 'Because the [a]foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.',
'1:26': 'For consider your calling, brothers, that there are not many [a]wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many [1]wellborn.',
'1:27': 'But God has [1a]chosen the foolish things of the [b]world that He might shame those <I>who</I> <I>are</I> wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the [b]world that He might shame the things that are strong,',
'1:28': 'And the [1]lowborn things of the world and the [2]despised things God has chosen, things which [3a]are not, that He might [b]bring to nought the [4]things which are,',
'1:29': '[1]So that no flesh may [a]boast before God.',
'1:30': 'But [1a]of Him you are [b]in Christ Jesus, who became [c]wisdom to us from God: both [2d]righteousness and [e]sanctification and [f]redemption,',
'1:31': 'That as it is written, [a]&ldquo;He who boasts, let him [b]boast in the Lord.&rdquo;',
'2:1': 'And I, when I [a]came to you, brothers, came not according to [1]excellence of [b]speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the [2c]mystery of God.',
'2:2': 'For I did [1]not determine to know anything among you except [2]Jesus [a]Christ, and [2]this One [b]crucified.',
'2:3': 'And I was with you in [1a]weakness and in [2b]fear and in much trembling;',
'2:4': 'And my [a]speech and my proclamation were not in [1]persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the [b]Spirit and of [c]power,',
'2:5': 'In order that your faith would not [1]stand in the [2]wisdom of men but in the [a]power of God.',
'2:6': 'But we do speak wisdom among those who are [a]full-grown, yet a [b]wisdom not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are being [1c]brought to nought;',
'2:7': 'But we speak [1]God&rsquo;s wisdom in a [a]mystery, the <I>wisdom</I> which has been hidden, which God [b]predestined [2]before the [c]ages for our [3d]glory,',
'2:8': 'Which none of the [a]rulers of this age have known; for if they had known, they would not have [b]crucified the [c]Lord of glory;',
'2:9': 'But as it is written, [a]&ldquo;Things which [1]eye has not seen and ear has not heard and <I>which</I> have not [b]come up [2]in man&rsquo;s heart; things which God has [c]prepared for those who [3d]love Him.&rdquo;',
'2:10': 'But to us God has [1a]revealed <I>them</I> through the [b]Spirit, for the Spirit [2]searches all things, even the [3c]depths of God.',
'2:11': 'For who among men knows the things of man, except the [1a]spirit of man which is in him? In the same way, the things of God also no one has known except the Spirit of God.',
'2:12': 'But we have [1a]received not the spirit of the [b]world but the [c]Spirit which is from God, that we may [d]know the [e]things which have been graciously given to us by God;',
'2:13': 'Which things also we speak, not in [a]words taught by human wisdom but in words [b]taught by the Spirit, [1]interpreting spiritual things [2]with spiritual <I>words</I>.',
'2:14': '[1]But a [2a]soulish man does [b]not receive the [3c]things of the Spirit of God, for they are [d]foolishness to him and he is [4]not able to know <I>them</I> because they are [5e]discerned [6]spiritually.',
'2:15': 'But the [1a]spiritual man discerns all things, but he himself is discerned by no one.',
'2:16': 'For who has known the [a]mind of the Lord and will [b]instruct Him? But we [1]have the [c]mind of Christ.',
'3:1': 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to [1a]spiritual men, but as to [2b]fleshy, as to [3c]infants in Christ.',
'3:2': 'I [1]gave you [2a]milk to drink, not [2]solid [b]food, for you were [c]not yet able <I>to</I> <I>receive</I> <I>it</I>. But [3]neither yet now are you able,',
'3:3': 'For you are still [a]fleshly. For if there is [1b]jealousy and [c]strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk [2]according to <I>the</I> <I>manner</I> <I>of</I> man?',
'3:4': 'For when someone says, [a]I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men <I>of</I> <I>flesh</I>?',
'3:5': 'What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? [a]Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to [b]each one <I>of</I> <I>them</I>.',
'3:6': '[a]I [1]planted, [b]Apollos watered, but [c]God caused the growth.',
'3:7': 'So then [1]neither is he who plants [a]anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth.',
'3:8': 'Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but [a]each will receive his own [1b]reward according to his own [c]labor.',
'3:9': 'For we are [1]God&rsquo;s [a]fellow workers; you are God&rsquo;s [2b]cultivated land, God&rsquo;s [c]building.',
'3:10': 'According to the [a]grace of God given to me, as a wise [1]master builder I have [b]laid a [c]foundation, and [d]another [e]builds upon <I>it</I>. But let each man [2]take heed how he [f]builds upon <I>it</I>.',
'3:11': 'For [1a]another foundation no one is able to lay besides [b]that which is laid, which is Jesus [c]Christ.',
'3:12': '[1]But if anyone builds upon the foundation [2]gold, silver, precious stones, [3]wood, grass, stubble,',
'3:13': 'The work of each will become [a]manifest; for [1b]the day will declare <I>it</I>, because it is revealed by [2c]fire, and the fire itself will [d]prove each one&rsquo;s work, of what sort it is.',
'3:14': 'If anyone&rsquo;s [1]work which he has built upon <I>the</I> <I>foundation</I> remains, he will receive a [2a]reward;',
'3:15': 'If anyone&rsquo;s [1]work is consumed, he will suffer [2]loss, but he himself will be [3a]saved, yet so as [4]through [b]fire.',
'3:16': 'Do you not know that you are the [1a]temple of God, and <I>that</I> the [b]Spirit of God dwells in you?',
'3:17': 'If anyone [1a]destroys the temple of God, God will [2]destroy him; for the temple of God is [3]holy, <I>and</I> [4]such are you.',
'3:18': 'Let no one [1a]deceive himself; if anyone [2b]thinks that he is [c]wise among you in this age, let him [3]become foolish that he may [4]become wise.',
'3:19': 'For the wisdom of this world is [a]foolishness with God; for it is written, [b]&ldquo;He grasps the wise in their craftiness&rdquo;;',
'3:20': 'And again, [a]&ldquo;The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are [1]vain.&rdquo;',
'3:21': 'So then let no one [a]boast in men, for [b]all things are yours,',
'3:22': 'Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or [a]life or death or things present or things to come; [1]all are yours,',
'3:23': 'But you are [a]Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ is [b]God&rsquo;s.',
'4:1': 'A man should [1]account us [2]in this way, as [3a]servants of Christ and [4b]stewards of the [c]mysteries of God.',
'4:2': '[1]Here, furthermore, it is sought in stewards that one be found [a]faithful.',
'4:3': 'But to me it is a very small thing that I should be [1a]examined by you or by [2]man&rsquo;s day; rather I do not even examine myself.',
'4:4': 'For I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord.',
'4:5': 'So then do not [1a]judge anything [2]before the time, until the Lord [b]comes, who will both bring to light the [c]hidden things of darkness and make [d]manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be [e]praise to each from God.',
'4:6': 'Now [1]these things, brothers, I have [2]transferred in figure to myself and [a]Apollos for your sakes, that you may learn in us the matter of not <I>going</I> beyond [3]what has been written, that none of you may be [b]puffed up on behalf of [c]one, against the other.',
'4:7': 'For [1]who distinguishes you? And what do you have that you did not [a]receive? And if you did receive <I>it</I>, why do you boast as though not having received <I>it</I>?',
'4:8': '[1]Already you are filled; already you have become [a]rich; you have reigned without us. And I would have it indeed that you did reign, that we also might reign with you.',
'4:9': 'For, I think, God has set forth us the apostles [1]last <I>of</I> <I>all</I> as [2]doomed to [a]death, because we have become a [3b]spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.',
'4:10': 'We are [1a]fools because of Christ, but you are [b]prudent in Christ; we are [2c]weak, but you are strong; you are [3]glorious, but we are [d]dishonored.',
'4:11': 'Until the present hour we both [a]hunger and thirst, and are naked and [b]buffeted and wander without a home;',
'4:12': 'And we labor, [a]working with our own [b]hands. Reviled we [c]bless; [d]persecuted we endure;',
'4:13': '[1]Defamed we [2]exhort. We have become as the [3a]offscouring of the world, the [3]scum of all things, until now.',
'4:14': 'It is not to [a]shame you <I>that</I> I write these things but to admonish <I>you</I> as my beloved [b]children.',
'4:15': 'For though you have ten thousand [1]guides in Christ, yet <I>you</I> <I>do</I> not <I>have</I> many [2a]fathers; for [b]in Christ Jesus I have [c]begotten you through the [d]gospel.',
'4:16': 'I [1]exhort you therefore, Become [a]imitators of me.',
'4:17': 'Because of this I have sent [a]Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful [b]child in the Lord, who will remind you of my [1]ways which are in Christ, even as I teach [2]everywhere in every [c]church.',
'4:18': 'Now some have become [a]puffed up as though I were not coming to you.',
'4:19': 'But I will [a]come to you shortly, if the Lord [b]wills, and I will ascertain not the speech of those who are puffed up but the power.',
'4:20': 'For the [1a]kingdom of God is not in speech but in [b]power.',
'4:21': 'What do you want? Should I [a]come to you with a [1]rod or in love and a [2b]spirit of [c]meekness?',
'5:1': 'It is actually reported that there is [1a]fornication among you, and such fornication that <I>does</I> not even <I>occur</I> among the Gentiles, that someone has his [2b]stepmother.',
'5:2': 'And you are [a]puffed up? And have you not rather [b]mourned, that the one who has done this deed might be [1c]removed from your midst?',
'5:3': 'For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present [1]in the [a]spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this,',
'5:4': '[1]In the [a]name of our Lord Jesus, when you and [2]my [b]spirit have been assembled, [1]with the [c]power of our Lord Jesus,',
'5:5': '[1]To [a]deliver such a one to [b]Satan for the [2]destruction of his [3]flesh, [4]that his spirit may be saved in the [5c]day of the Lord.',
'5:6': 'Your [1a]boasting is not good. Do you not know that a [2]little [3b]leaven leavens the whole lump?',
'5:7': 'Purge out the old leaven that you may be a [1]new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our [2a]Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.',
'5:8': 'So then let us [a]keep the [1]feast, not with old [b]leaven, neither with the leaven of [c]malice and evil, but with the [d]unleavened <I>bread</I> of sincerity and truth.',
'5:9': 'I wrote to you in my letter [a]not to [1]mingle with fornicators,',
'5:10': '<I>But</I> not altogether with the [a]fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to go [b]out of the world.',
'5:11': 'But now I have written to you not to mingle with anyone who is called a [a]brother, if he is a [1]fornicator or a covetous man or an [b]idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one [c]not even to eat.',
'5:12': 'For what have I to do with judging those who are [a]outside <I>the</I> <I>church</I>? Do you not [b]judge those who are within <I>the</I> <I>church</I>?',
'5:13': 'But those who are outside, God will judge. [1a]Remove the evil man from among yourselves.',
'6:1': 'Does any one of you who has a [1]case against another dare to be judged before the [2]unrighteous and not before the saints?',
'6:2': 'Or do you not know that the saints will [1a]judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of the [2]smallest [3]judgments?',
'6:3': 'Do you not know that we will [1]judge angels, not to mention things of this life?',
'6:4': 'If then you hold [a]judgments over things of this life, do you seat <I>as</I> <I>judges</I> [1]those who are of no account in the church?',
'6:5': 'I say <I>this</I> to your [a]shame. So there is no one wise among you, who will be able to discern between his [b]brothers?',
'6:6': 'But brother [1]goes to court with brother, and this before [a]unbelievers.',
'6:7': 'Already then it is altogether a [1]defeat to you that you have [2]lawsuits with one another. Why not [3a]rather be wronged? Why not [3]rather be defrauded?',
'6:8': 'But you wrong and [a]defraud, and this <I>your</I> brothers.',
'6:9': 'Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not [1a]inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be [b]led astray; neither [c]fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor [d]homosexuals',
'6:10': 'Nor thieves nor the covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not the rapacious will inherit the kingdom of God.',
'6:11': 'And these things were some of you; but you were [1a]washed, but you were [1b]sanctified, but you were [1c]justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.',
'6:12': '[1a]All things are [2]lawful to me, but not all things are [3]profitable; all things are [2]lawful to me, but I will not be [4]brought under the power of anything.',
'6:13': '[1]Foods are for the [a]stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to [b]nought both it and them. But the [2]body is not for fornication but [c]for the Lord, and the Lord [d]for the body.',
'6:14': 'And God has both [a]raised up the Lord and will [1b]raise us up through His [c]power.',
'6:15': 'Do you not know that your bodies are [1a]members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make <I>them</I> members of a prostitute? [2b]Absolutely not!',
'6:16': 'Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For He says, [a]&ldquo;The two shall be one flesh.&rdquo;',
'6:17': 'But he who is [1a]joined to the Lord is [2b]one spirit.',
'6:18': '[a]Flee [b]fornication. Every [1]sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.',
'6:19': 'Or do you not know that your [a]body is a [b]temple of the [1]Holy Spirit [c]within you, whom you have [d]from God, and you are [e]not your own?',
'6:20': 'For you have been [a]bought with a [1b]price. So then [2c]glorify God in your [d]body.',
'7:1': 'Now concerning the [1]things of which you wrote: It is [a]good for a man not to touch a woman.',
'7:2': 'But because of [1a]fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.',
'7:3': 'Let the [a]husband render to his wife that which is due, and likewise also the wife to the husband.',
'7:4': 'The [a]wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.',
'7:5': 'Do not deprive each other, [a]except by agreement for a time that you may [1]devote yourselves to prayer, and <I>then</I> be together again, that [2b]Satan may not [c]tempt you because of your [3]lack of [d]self-control.',
'7:6': 'But this I say by way of [1]concession, not by way of [1a]command.',
'7:7': 'Yet I [1]wish all men to be even as I am myself; but each has his own [2]gift from God, one in this way, the other in that.',
'7:8': 'But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is [1a]good for them if they remain even as I am.',
'7:9': 'But if they do not have [1a]self-control, let them [b]marry; for it is better to marry than to burn <I>with</I> <I>desire</I>.',
'7:10': 'But to the married [1]I charge, [2a]not I but the Lord, A [b]wife must not be [c]separated from <I>her</I> husband',
'7:11': '(But if indeed she is separated, let her [1]remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband), and a [a]husband must not leave <I>his</I> wife.',
'7:12': 'But to the rest [1]I say, I, [a]not the Lord, If any brother has an unbelieving wife and she consents to dwell with him, he must not [b]leave her;',
'7:13': 'And a wife who has an unbelieving husband, and <I>if</I> he consents to dwell with her, must not leave her husband.',
'7:14': 'For the unbelieving husband is [1a]sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.',
'7:15': 'But if the unbelieving one separates, let him separate; the brother or the sister is [1]not enslaved in such <I>cases</I>, [2]but God has called us in [a]peace.',
'7:16': '[1]For [2]how do you know, O [a]wife, whether you will [b]save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?',
'7:17': '[1]However as the Lord has apportioned to each one, as God has [a]called each one, so let him walk. And so I direct in all the [b]churches.',
'7:18': 'Was anyone called having been circumcised? He need not [1]efface <I>it</I>. Has anyone been called in uncircumcision? He need not be [a]circumcised.',
'7:19': '[1a]Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the [b]keeping of God&rsquo;s commandments <I>is</I> <I>what</I> <I>counts</I>.',
'7:20': 'Each one, in the [a]calling in which he was called, in this let him remain.',
'7:21': 'Were you called as a [a]slave? [1]Let it not concern you; [2]but even if you are able to become [b]free, [c]use <I>your</I> <I>status</I> <I>as</I> <I>a</I> <I>slave</I> rather.',
'7:22': 'For the slave who has been called in the Lord is the [1]Lord&rsquo;s freedman; likewise the free man who has been called is [1]Christ&rsquo;s [a]slave.',
'7:23': 'You were [a]bought with a [1]price; do not be [2b]slaves of men.',
'7:24': 'Each one, brothers, in what <I>status</I> he was [a]called, in this let him remain [1]with God.',
'7:25': 'Now concerning [a]virgins I have [b]no [1]commandment of the Lord, but I give [1]<I>my</I> [c]opinion as one who has been shown [d]mercy by the Lord to be [e]faithful.',
'7:26': 'I consider then that this is good because of the [1]present [2]necessity, that <I>it</I> <I>is</I> [a]good for a man to be as he is.',
'7:27': 'Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek a release. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.',
'7:28': 'But even if you do [a]marry, you have [b]not sinned; and if the virgin marries, she has not sinned; but such ones will have affliction in the flesh, and I am trying to spare you.',
'7:29': 'But this I say, brothers, the time is [1a]shortened. Henceforth both those who have wives should be as though they had none,',
'7:30': 'And those who weep as though they did not weep, and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, and those who buy as though they did not possess,',
'7:31': 'And those who use the world as though they did not abuse <I>it</I>; for the fashion of this world is [a]passing away.',
'7:32': 'But I desire you to be without [a]care. The unmarried [b]cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord;',
'7:33': 'But he who has married [a]cares for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,',

'14:13': 'Therefore let him who speaks in a tongue pray that he may [a]interpret.',
'14:14': 'For if I pray in a tongue, my [1a]spirit prays, but my [1b]mind is unfruitful.',
'14:15': 'What then? I will pray with the [a]spirit, and I will pray [1]also [2]with the mind; I will [b]sing with the spirit, and I will [c]sing [1]also [2]with the mind.',
'14:16': 'Otherwise if you [a]bless with the spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the [1]unlearned <I>in</I> <I>tongues</I> say the [2b]Amen at your giving of [c]thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?',
'14:17': 'For you give thanks well, but the other is not [1a]built up.',

'14:22': 'So then tongues are for a [1]sign, not to those who believe but to the unbelievers; but prophecy <I>is</I> <I>for</I> <I>a</I> <I>sign</I> not to the unbelievers but to those who believe.',
'14:23': 'If therefore the whole church [a]comes together in one place, and [1]all speak in tongues, and some unlearned <I>in</I> <I>tongues</I> or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are [2b]insane?',

'15:3': 'For I delivered to you, first of all, that which also I [a]received, that [1]Christ [b]died for our [c]sins according to the [2d]Scriptures;',
'15:4': 'And that He was [a]buried, and that He has been [b]raised on the [c]third day according to the [d]Scriptures;',
'15:5': 'And that He [1]appeared to [a]Cephas, then to the [b]twelve;',
'15:6': 'Then He appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the majority remain until now, but some have fallen asleep;',
'15:7': 'Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles;',
'15:8': 'And last of all He appeared to [a]me also, as it were to one born prematurely.',
'15:9': 'For I am the [a]least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle, because I [b]persecuted the [c]church of God.',
'15:10': 'But by the [1a]grace of God I am what I am; and His [b]grace unto me did not turn out to be [c]in vain, but, on the contrary, I [d]labored more abundantly than all of them, yet [2]not I but the grace of God which is with me.',
'15:11': 'Therefore whether it is I or they, so we preach and so you have believed.',

'15:17': 'And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is [1]futile; you are [2]still in your [a]sins.',

'15:32': 'If [1]after the manner of men I fought with [2]wild beasts at [a]Ephesus, what does it profit me? If the dead are [b]not raised, [3]let us [c]eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.',
'15:33': 'Do not be [a]deceived: [1]Evil [2b]companionships [c]corrupt good morals.',

'15:35': 'But someone will say, How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?',
'15:36': 'Foolish man, [1]what you sow is not made alive unless it [a]dies;',
'15:37': 'And what you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare grain, perhaps of wheat or of some <I>other</I> of the rest.',
'15:38': 'But God gives it a [1]body even as He willed, and to each of the seeds its own [1]body.',
'15:39': '[1]All [a]flesh is not the same flesh, but one is of [b]men, and another flesh is of [c]cattle, and another is of [d]birds, and another is of fish.',
'15:40': 'There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one thing, and that of the earthly is another.',
'15:41': 'There is another glory of the [a]sun, and another glory of the [b]moon, and another glory of the [c]stars; for star differs from star in glory.',
'15:42': 'So [a]also is the [b]resurrection of the dead. It is sown in [c]corruption, it is [d]raised in incorruption;',

'15:44': 'It is sown a [1a]soulish body, it is raised a [1b]spiritual [c]body. If there is a soulish body, there is also a spiritual one.',
'15:45': 'So also it is written, &ldquo;The first man, [a]Adam, became a [b]living [1]soul&rdquo;; the last Adam <I>became</I> a [c]life-giving [1]Spirit.',

'15:50': 'Now this I say, brothers, that [1a]flesh and blood cannot inherit the [b]kingdom of God, neither does [c]corruption inherit [d]incorruption.',
'15:51': 'Behold, I tell you [a]a [1]mystery: We will not all [2b]sleep, but we will all be [3c]changed,',
'15:52': 'In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the [1]last [a]trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the [2]dead will be [b]raised incorruptible, and [3]we will be changed.',

The first two meanings should be applied to the first three of the five items listed in this verse, and the third to the last two&mdash;a tongue and an interpretation of a tongue. This indicates that when we come to the church meeting, we should have something of the Lord to share with others, whether a psalm to praise the Lord, a teaching (of the teacher) to minister the riches of Christ to edify and nourish others, a revelation (of the prophet, {1Co14:30|v. 30}) to give visions of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose concerning Christ as God&rsquo;s mystery and the church as Christ&rsquo;s mystery, a tongue for a sign to the unbelievers ({1Co14:22|v. 22}) that they may know and accept Christ, or an interpretation to make a tongue concerning Christ and His Body understandable. Before coming to the meeting, we should prepare ourselves for the meeting with such things from the Lord and of the Lord, either through our experience of Him or through our enjoyment of His word and fellowship with Him in prayer. After coming into the meeting, we need not wait, and should not wait, for inspiration; we should exercise our spirit and use our trained mind to function in presenting what we have prepared to the Lord for His glory and satisfaction and to the attendants for their benefit&mdash;their enlightenment, nourishment, and building up.","This is like the Feast of Tabernacles in ancient times. The children of Israel brought the produce of the good land, which they had reaped from their labor on the land, to the feast and offered it to the Lord for His enjoyment and for their mutual participation in fellowship with the Lord and with one another. We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting and offer. Thus the meeting will be an exhibition of Christ in His riches and will be a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.","According to the stress and emphasis of this Epistle, all five items listed in this verse should focus on Christ as God&rsquo;s center for our portion and the church as God&rsquo;s goal for our aim. The psalm should be the praise to God for giving Christ as wisdom and power to us for our daily life and church life. The teaching from a teacher and the revelation from a prophet should teach and minister Christ and the church, which is the Body of Christ, to people. A tongue and its interpretation also should have Christ and the church as their center and content. Any stress on things other than Christ and the church will bring confusion to the church and distract it from the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, making it like the church in Corinth."]},

If there were no resurrection, Christ would not have been raised from the dead. He would be a dead Savior, not a living One who lives forever ({Rev1:18|Rev. 1:18}) and is able to save to the uttermost ({Heb7:25|Heb. 7:25}). If there were no resurrection, there would be no living proof of our being justified by His death ({Rom4:25|Rom. 4:25} and {Rom4:25^1|note}), no imparting of life ({Joh12:24|John 12:24}), no regeneration ({Joh3:5|John 3:5}), no renewing ({Tit3:5|Titus 3:5}), no transformation ({Rom12:2|Rom. 12:2}; {2Co3:18|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18}), and no conformity to the image of Christ ({Rom8:29|Rom. 8:29}). If there were no resurrection, there would be no members of Christ ({Rom12:5|Rom. 12:5}), no Body of Christ as His fullness ({Eph1:20|Eph. 1:20}-{Eph1:23|23}), and no church as Christ&rsquo;s bride ({Joh3:29|John 3:29}), and therefore no new man ({Eph2:15|Eph. 2:15}; {Eph4:24|4:24}; {Col3:10|Col. 3:10}-{Col3:11|11}). If there were no resurrection, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy would altogether collapse and God&rsquo;s eternal purpose would be nullified."]},
