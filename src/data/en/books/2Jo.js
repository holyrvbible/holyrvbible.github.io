'1:2': '[1]For the sake of the [2]truth which [a]abides in us and will be [b]with us forever:',
'1:3': '[a]Grace, mercy, [b]peace will be with [1]us from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in [2]truth and love.',
'1:4': 'I [1]rejoiced greatly that I have found <I>some</I> of your children [a]walking in [2]truth, even as we received [3b]commandment from the Father.',
'1:5': 'And now I ask you, lady, not as writing a [a]new commandment to you but [1]that which we have had [2]from the beginning, that we [b]love one another.',
'1:6': 'And this is [a]love, that we [b]walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you walk in [1]love.',
'1:7': 'For many [1]deceivers [a]went out into the world, those who [2]do [b]not confess Jesus Christ coming [3]in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the [4]antichrist.',
'1:8': '[1a]Look to yourselves that you do not [2]lose the [3]things which we wrought, but that you may receive a full [4]reward.',
'1:9': 'Everyone who [1]goes beyond and does not abide in the [2]teaching of Christ does [a]not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he [3]has both the Father and the Son.',
'1:10': 'If anyone comes to you and does [a]not [1]bring this teaching, do [b]not receive [2]him into <I>your</I> house, and do not say to him, [3]Rejoice!',
'1:11': 'For he who says to him, Rejoice, [a]shares in his [1]evil works.',
'1:12': 'Though I have [a]many things to write to you, I do not want to <I>do</I> <I>so</I> with paper and ink, but I am [1b]hoping to be with you and to speak [2]face to face that [3]our [c]joy may be made full.',

God&rsquo;s truth is that the Triune God was incarnated to be the God-man, Christ, who had both divinity and humanity, who through crucifixion accomplished eternal redemption and through resurrection became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, to be received by those who repent and believe in Him, as their life and as their everything. The aged apostle&rsquo;s desire was that the believers would love one another in this truth by the divine love of the Triune God to express Him. This truth, this reality, became the genuineness in the apostle&rsquo;s walk, the divine virtue expressed in his redeemed humanity. He loved the believers whom he cared for, in the genuineness of the divine virtue. His love toward the believers was his living, in which the reality, the truth, of the Triune God was joined to the love of the Triune God.
