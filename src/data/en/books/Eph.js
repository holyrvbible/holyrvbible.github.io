'1:3': '[1a]Blessed be the [2b]God and Father of [3]our Lord Jesus Christ, who has [4]blessed us [5]with every [6]spiritual [7]blessing in the [8c]heavenlies [9]in Christ,',
'1:4': 'Even as He [1a]chose us in Him [2b]before the foundation of the world to be [3c]holy and [4]without blemish [5]before Him [6]in [7d]love,',
'1:5': '[1a]Predestinating us unto [2b]sonship [3]through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the [4c]good pleasure of His [d]will,',
'1:6': 'To the [1a]praise of the [2b]glory of His [c]grace, with which He [3]graced us in the [4d]Beloved;',
'1:7': 'In whom we have [1a]redemption through His [b]blood, the [2c]forgiveness of [d]offenses, according to the [e]riches of His grace,',
'1:8': 'Which He caused to [1]abound to us in all [2a]wisdom and prudence,',
'1:9': '[1]Making known to us the [2a]mystery of His [b]will [3]according to His [c]good pleasure, which He [4d]purposed in Himself,',

'1:12': 'That we would be to the [1a]praise of His glory who have [2]first hoped in Christ.',
'1:13': 'In whom you also, having heard the [a]word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Him also believing, you were [1b]sealed with the [c]Holy Spirit of the [2]promise,',
'1:14': 'Who is the [1a]pledge of our [2b]inheritance [3]unto the [4c]redemption of the [5]acquired [d]possession, to the [6e]praise of His glory.',
'1:15': 'Therefore I also, having [a]heard of [1]the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you and your love to all the saints,',
'1:16': 'Do not cease [a]giving thanks for you, making mention <I>of</I> <I>you</I> in my prayers,',

'1:19': 'And what is the surpassing greatness of His [1a]power toward us who believe, [2]according to the [b]operation of the [c]might of His strength,',
'1:20': 'Which He caused to operate in Christ in [1a]raising Him from the dead and [2b]seating Him at His [3]right hand in the [4c]heavenlies,',
'1:21': 'Far above all [1a]rule and authority and power and lordship and [2]every [b]name that is named not only in this [c]age but also in that which is to come;',
'1:22': 'And He [1a]subjected all things under His feet and [2]gave Him <I>to</I> <I>be</I> [b]Head over all things [3]to the [4c]church,',
'1:23': 'Which is His [1a]Body, the [2b]fullness of the One who [3c]fills all in all.',

'2:4': '[1]But God, being [a]rich in [2]mercy, because of His [3]great [b]love with which He loved us,',
'2:5': 'Even when we were [a]dead in offenses, made us [1b]alive [2]together with [3]Christ (by [4c]grace you have been [5]saved)',
'2:6': 'And [1a]raised <I>us</I> up [2]together with <I>Him</I> and [3b]seated <I>us</I> together with <I>Him</I> in the [4c]heavenlies [5]in Christ Jesus,',
'2:7': 'That He might [1]display in the [2]ages to come the surpassing [3a]riches of His grace in [4b]kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.',
'2:8': '[1]For by [2a]grace you have been saved through [3b]faith, and [4]this not of yourselves; <I>it</I> <I>is</I> the [c]gift of God;',
'2:9': 'Not of [a]works that no one should [b]boast.',
'2:10': 'For we are His [1]masterpiece, [2a]created in Christ Jesus for [b]good works, which God prepared [3]beforehand in order that we would [c]walk in them.',
'2:11': 'Therefore remember that once you, the [a]Gentiles in the flesh, those who are called [1b]uncircumcision by that which is called [c]circumcision in the flesh made by hands,',
'2:12': 'That you were at that time [1]apart from Christ, [a]alienated from the [2]commonwealth of [b]Israel, and strangers to the [3c]covenants of the promise, having [4d]no hope and [5]without God in the [6]world.',
'2:13': '[1]But now in Christ Jesus you who were once [2a]far off have become [3]near in the [4b]blood of Christ.',

'2:15': '[1a]Abolishing in His [2]flesh the [3]law of the commandments in [4]ordinances, that He might [5]create the two [6]in Himself [7]into [8]one [b]new man, <I>so</I> [9c]making peace,',

'2:18': 'For [1]through Him we both have [2a]access [3]in [b]one Spirit unto the [4c]Father.',
'2:19': 'So then [1]you are no longer [2a]strangers and sojourners, but you are [3b]fellow citizens with the saints and [4]members of the [c]household of God,',
'2:20': 'Being [1a]built upon the [2b]foundation of the [c]apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the [3d]cornerstone;',

'5:22': '[1a]Wives, <I>be</I> [b]<I>subject</I> [2]to your [3]own husbands as to the Lord;',

'5:28': 'In the same way the husbands also ought to [a]love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.',
'5:29': 'For no one ever hated his own flesh, but [1a]nourishes and [b]cherishes it, even as Christ also the church,',
'5:30': 'Because we are [a]members of His [b]Body.',
'5:31': '[a]For this cause a man shall [1]leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be [2b]one flesh.',
'5:32': 'This [a]mystery is great, but I speak with regard to [1]Christ [b]and the church.',
'5:33': 'Nevertheless you also, each one of you, in the same way [a]love [1]your own wife as yourself; and the wife should [2b]fear her husband.',

'6:10': '[1]Finally, [2]be [3a]empowered [4b]in the Lord and in the [c]might of His strength.',
'6:11': '[1a]Put on the [2]whole [b]armor of God that you may be able to [3c]stand against the [4d]stratagems of the [e]devil,',
