'1:1': '[a]Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the [1]church of the [2]Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:',
'1:2': 'Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.',
'1:3': 'We ought to [a]thank God always concerning you, brothers, even as it is fitting, because your [1b]faith grows exceedingly and the love of each one of you all to one another is increasing,',
'1:4': 'So that we ourselves [a]boast in you among the churches of God concerning your [1]endurance and faith in all your [b]persecutions and the afflictions which you bear,',
'1:5': 'A plain [a]indication of the [1]righteous judgment of God, that you may be accounted [b]worthy of the [2c]kingdom of God, for which also you suffer;',
'1:6': 'Since <I>it</I> <I>is</I> just with God to repay with affliction those afflicting you,',
'1:7': 'And to you who are being afflicted, [1]rest with us at the [a]revelation of the Lord Jesus from [b]heaven with the [c]angels of His power, in flaming [d]fire,',
'1:8': 'Rendering vengeance to those who do [a]not know God and to those who do not [b]obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus [1]Christ.',
'1:9': 'They will pay the penalty of eternal [a]destruction from the [1]presence of the Lord and from the [b]glory of His strength',
'1:10': 'When He [a]comes to be [1b]glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed (because our [c]testimony to you was believed) in [d]that day.',
'1:11': 'For which also we [a]pray always concerning you, that our God may count you [b]worthy of your calling and may fulfill in [c]power <I>your</I> every [1]good intention for goodness and <I>your</I> [d]work of faith,',
'1:12': 'So that the [a]name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in Him, according to the [1]grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.',
'2:1': 'Now we ask you, brothers, [1]with regard to the [2a]coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our [b]gathering together [3]to Him,',
'2:2': 'That you be not quickly shaken [1]in mind nor alarmed, neither by a [2a]spirit nor by word nor by a letter as if by us, to the effect that the [3]day of the Lord has come.',
'2:3': 'Let no one [1]deceive you in any way, because <I>it</I> <I>will</I> <I>not</I> <I>come</I> unless the [2a]apostasy comes first and the [3]man of [b]lawlessness is revealed, the [c]son of [d]perdition,',
'2:4': 'Who opposes and [1a]exalts himself above all that is called [b]God or an object of worship, so that he [c]sits in the [2d]temple of God, setting himself forth, <I>saying</I> that [e]he is God.',
'2:5': 'Do you not remember that while I was still with you, I said these things to you?',
'2:6': 'And now you know that which [1]restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own [2]time.',
'2:7': 'For <I>it</I> <I>is</I> the [1]mystery of [a]lawlessness <I>that</I> is now operating, <I>but</I> only until the one now restraining [2]goes out of the way.',
'2:8': 'And then the [a]lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will [1]slay by the [2b]breath of His [c]mouth and [d]bring to nothing by the [3]manifestation of His [4e]coming),',
'2:9': 'The coming of whom is [1]according to Satan&rsquo;s operation in all [a]power and [b]signs and wonders of a [2]lie',
'2:10': 'And in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are [a]perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved.',
'2:11': 'And [1]because of this God [a]sends to them an operation of error that they might believe the [b]lie,',
'2:12': 'So that all who have not believed the [a]truth but have taken [1]pleasure in unrighteousness might be judged.',
'2:13': 'But we ought to [a]thank God always concerning you, brothers [b]beloved of the Lord, because God [1c]chose you [2]from the [d]beginning unto [e]salvation in [3f]sanctification of the Spirit and [4]belief of the [g]truth,',
'2:14': 'To [1]which also He [a]called you through our [b]gospel unto the obtaining of the [2c]glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.',
'2:15': 'So then, brothers, [a]stand firm and hold to the [1b]things which were handed down <I>to</I> <I>you</I> <I>and</I> which you were taught, whether by word or by our letter.',
'2:16': 'Now our [1]Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has [a]loved us and given us [2]eternal comfort and [3]good [b]hope in [4]grace,',
'2:17': 'Comfort your hearts and [a]establish <I>you</I> in every good work and word.',
'3:1': 'Finally, brothers, [a]pray concerning us, that the word of the Lord may [b]run and be [1]glorified, even as <I>it</I> <I>is</I> also [2]with you;',
'3:2': 'And that we may be [a]delivered from unreasonable and evil men, for the [b]faith does not belong to all.',
'3:3': 'But the Lord is [a]faithful, who will [1b]establish you and [2]guard <I>you</I> from the [c]evil one.',
'3:4': 'And we have [a]confidence in the Lord concerning you that what we [1b]charge, you both are doing and will do.',
'3:5': 'And the Lord [1a]direct your [b]hearts [2]into the [3c]love of God and [4]into the [5]endurance of Christ.',
'3:6': 'Now we charge you, brothers, in the [a]name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you [b]keep away from every brother [1]walking [c]disorderly and not according to the [2d]things which were handed down <I>to</I> <I>you</I> <I>and</I> which you received from us.',
'3:7': 'For you yourselves know how you ought to [a]imitate us, because we were [1]not disorderly among you;',
'3:8': 'Nor did we eat bread <I>as</I> a gift from anyone, but in [a]labor and hardship we [b]worked night and day so that we would not be [c]burdensome to any of you;',
'3:9': 'Not because we do not have the [a]right, but in order that we might give ourselves to you as a [b]pattern that you might [c]imitate us.',
'3:10': 'For even when we were with you, we gave you this [a]charge, that if anyone does not want to work, neither should he [b]eat.',
'3:11': 'For we hear of some walking among you [a]disorderly, doing no work at all, but being [1b]busybodies.',
'3:12': 'Now such ones we [a]charge and [b]exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to [c]work with [d]quietness and [e]eat their own bread.',
'3:13': 'But you, brothers, do not [a]lose heart in doing good.',
'3:14': 'And if anyone does [a]not obey our word through this letter, mark this one so as [1b]not to mingle with him, in order that he may be ashamed.',
'3:15': 'Yet do not regard <I>him</I> as an enemy, but [a]admonish <I>him</I> as a brother.',
'3:16': 'Now the Lord of [a]peace Himself give you [1b]peace continually in every way. The Lord be [c]with you all.',
'3:17': 'The greeting in [a]my own hand&mdash;Paul&mdash;which is the mark in every letter; so I write.',
'3:18': 'The [1a]grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.',

Two matters are covered here: the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (presence) and our gathering together (rapture) to Him. The Lord&rsquo;s parousia will begin with the rapture of the overcomers to the throne of God in heaven ({Rev12:5|Rev. 12:5}-{Rev12:6|6}); at the end of the great tribulation, which will occur in the last three and a half years of this age, the second half of the last week in {Dan9:27|Dan. 9:27} ({Mat24:21|Matt. 24:21} and {Mat24:21^1|note}; {Rev11:2|Rev. 11:2} and {Rev11:2^4|note 4}), it will come to the air ({Rev10:1|Rev. 10:1} and {Rev10:1^2|note 2}) and last for a time; and it will end with its manifestation, &ldquo;the manifestation of His parousia&rdquo; ({2Th2:8|v. 8}; {Mat24:30|Matt. 24:30} and {Mat24:30^4|note 4}). During the time in which the Lord&rsquo;s parousia remains in the air, the majority of the believers will be raptured to meet the Lord there ({1Th4:17|1&nbsp;Thes. 4:17}). According to the context, the day of the Lord in {2Th2:2|v. 2} refers to the day of the Lord&rsquo;s parousia (coming), in which the rapture of the majority of the believers will occur. {2Th2:3|Verse 3} tells us affirmatively that before that day Antichrist will be revealed to play the major role in the great tribulation ({2Th2:4|v. 4}; {Rev13:1|Rev. 13:1}-{Rev13:8|8}, {Rev13:12|12}-{Rev13:15|15}).
