verses: {
'1:1': '[1]How the city sits alone<br>That was full of people!<br>She who was once great among the nations<br>Has become like a widow;<br>She who was a princess among the provinces<br>Has become tributary.',
'1:2': 'Bitterly she weeps in the night,<br>And her tears are on her cheeks.<br>There is no one to [a]comfort her<br>Among all her lovers;<br>All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;<br>They have become her enemies.',

'1:8': 'Jerusalem has [a]sinned grievously;<br>Therefore she has become an impurity.<br>All who honored her despise her,<br>Because they have seen her nakedness;<br>And she groans<br>And turns backwards.',
'1:9': 'Her uncleanness is in her skirts;<br>She did not remember her latter end;<br>Therefore she has come down astonishingly;<br>There is no one to [a]comfort her.<br>O Jehovah, see my affliction,<br>For the enemy has magnified himself.',
'1:10': 'The adversary has spread out his hand<br>Over all her precious things,<br>For she has seen the nations<br>Enter her [a]sanctuary,<br>Concerning whom You commanded that they should not enter<br>Into Your [b]assembly.',

'1:20': 'See, O Jehovah, for I am in distress,<br>My bowels are in ferment;<br>My heart is overturned within me,<br>For I have been very rebellious.<br>In the street the sword bereaves;<br>In the house it is like death.',
'1:21': 'They have heard that I groan;<br>There is no one to comfort me;<br>All my enemies have heard of my trouble;<br>They are glad that You have done it.<br>You will bring the day that You have proclaimed,<br>And they will be like me.',

'2:2': 'The Lord has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob;<br>He has not spared;<br>He has torn down in His overflowing wrath<br>The strongholds of the daughter of Judah.<br>He has brought them down to the ground;<br>He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.',

'2:4': 'He has bent His bow like an enemy;<br>He has set His right hand like an adversary<br>And has slain all that was pleasant to the eye.<br>In the tent of the daughter of Zion<br>He has poured out His wrath like fire.',
'2:5': 'The Lord has become like an [a]enemy;<br>He has swallowed up Israel;<br>He has swallowed up all her palaces;<br>He has destroyed her strongholds<br>And multiplied in the daughter of Judah<br>Mourning and lamentation.',
'2:6': 'And He has violently taken away His [1]pavilion like a garden;<br>He has destroyed the place of His assembly;<br>Jehovah has caused the appointed feast and the Sabbath<br>To be forgotten in Zion;<br>He has despised, in the indignation of His anger,<br>The king and the priest.',
'2:7': 'The Lord has cast off His altar;<br>He has abhorred His sanctuary;<br>He has delivered up into the hand of the enemy<br>The walls of her palaces.<br>They have made a noise in the house of Jehovah<br>As though it were the day of an appointed feast.',
'2:8': 'Jehovah has thought to destroy<br>The walls of the daughter of Zion;<br>He has stretched out the [a]line<br>And has not withdrawn His hand from destroying;<br>And He has made the rampart and the wall to mourn;<br>They languish together.',
'2:9': 'Her gates have sunk into the ground;<br>He has destroyed and broken her bars;<br>Her [a]king and her princes are among nations<br>Where there is no law;<br>Her [b]prophets also do not find<br>A vision from Jehovah.',
'2:10': 'The elders of the daughter of Zion<br>Sit on the ground; they are silent.<br>They have cast dust upon their head;<br>They have girded themselves with sackcloth.<br>The virgins of Jerusalem<br>Hang down their head to the ground.',
'2:11': 'My eyes are consumed with [a]tears;<br>My bowels are in ferment;<br>My liver is poured out on the earth,<br>Because of the brokenness of the daughter of my people,<br>Because the little ones and the nursing children<br>Faint in the streets of the city.',
'2:12': 'They say to their mothers,<br>Where is the grain and the wine?<br>When they faint like one wounded<br>In the streets of the city,<br>When they pour out their soul<br>Into their mothers&rsquo; bosom.',
'2:13': 'What shall I testify to you? What shall I liken you to,<br>O daughter of Jerusalem?<br>What shall I compare you to, that I may comfort you,<br>O virgin daughter of Zion?<br>For your breach is great like a sea.<br>Who will heal you?',
'2:14': 'Your [a]prophets have seen for you<br>Vanity and folly,<br>And they have not uncovered your iniquity<br>To turn again your captivity;<br>But they have seen for you burdens<br>Of vanity and of causes of banishment.',
'2:15': 'All those who pass on the way<br>Clap their hands at you;<br>They hiss and wag their head<br>At the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,<br>Is this the city which they called,<br>[a]The perfection of beauty,<br>The joy of the whole earth?',
'2:16': 'All your enemies<br>Have opened their mouth against you;<br>They hiss and gnash the teeth;<br>They say, We have swallowed her up.<br>This is certainly the day that we have looked for;<br>We have found it; we have seen it.',
'2:17': 'Jehovah has done what He [a]purposed;<br>He has fulfilled His word,<br>Which He commanded from the days of old;<br>He has torn down and has not spared,<br>And He has caused the enemy to rejoice over you;<br>He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.',
'2:18': 'Their heart cried out to the Lord:<br>O wall of the daughter of Zion,<br>Let [a]tears run down like a stream<br>Day and night;<br>Give yourself no respite;<br>Let not the pupil of your eye cease.',
'2:19': 'Arise, cry out in the night<br>At the beginning of the watches;<br>Pour out your heart like water<br>Before the face of the Lord;<br>[a]Lift up your hands toward Him<br>For the life of your little ones,<br>Who faint because of famine<br>At the head of every street.',
'2:20': 'See, O Jehovah, and look,<br>With whom You have dealt thus?<br>Shall the women eat their fruit,<br>The little ones nursed by them?<br>Shall the priest and the prophet be slain<br>In the sanctuary of the Lord?',
'2:21': 'The youth and the old man<br>Lie on the ground in the streets;<br>My virgins and my young men<br>Have fallen by the sword;<br>You have slain them in the day of Your anger;<br>You have slaughtered; You have not spared.',

{sup:1, word:"How", lines:["This book, written by Jeremiah, the weeping and lamenting prophet ({Lam2:11|2:11}; {Lam3:48|3:48}; {Jer9:1|Jer. 9:1}), contains five lamentations expressing Jeremiah&rsquo;s sorrow and love for the holy city and the holy people of God. Jeremiah had prophesied concerning Israel&rsquo;s destruction carried out under God&rsquo;s governmental dealing, and he had also witnessed the destruction, devastation, contamination, capture, and ruin of the entire country, including Jerusalem. By God&rsquo;s sovereignty Jeremiah was free from captivity ({Jer40:1|Jer. 40:1}-{Jer40:6|6}). According to history Jeremiah sat on a hill overlooking Jerusalem, viewing all the ruins below. He began to weep, and he could not avoid writing down his feelings.","Jeremiah wrote his five lamentations in a very fine way. In Hebrew the first letter of each verse of chs. {Lam1|1}, {Lam2|2}, and {Lam4|4} follows the order of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. In {Lam3|ch. 3} every three verses form a group that begins with the same Hebrew letter, and the twenty-two groups formed follow the order of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet."]},
