verses: {
'1:1': '[1a]Now in the first year of Cyrus the king of Persia, so that the [b]word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, Jehovah [2c]stirred up the spirit of [3]Cyrus the king of Persia; and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing, saying,',
'1:2': 'Thus says [a]Cyrus the king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has Jehovah the [b]God of heaven given to me; and He has charged me to build Him a [1]house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.',
'1:3': 'Whoever there is among you of all His people, may his God be with him; and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and let him build the house of Jehovah the God of Israel&mdash;He is God&mdash;who is in Jerusalem.',

'1:6': 'And all those around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with cattle and with precious things, besides all that was offered willingly.',
'1:7': 'Also King Cyrus brought out the [1a]vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out from Jerusalem and had put in the house of his gods;',
'1:8': 'And Cyrus the king of Persia had them brought out by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer and had them enumerated to [1a]Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.',

'2:69': 'They gave to the treasury of the work, according to their ability, sixty-one thousand darics of gold and five thousand minas of silver and one hundred priestly garments.',
'2:70': 'So the priests and the Levites and some of the people and the singers and the gatekeepers and the temple servants and all Israel dwelt in their cities.',
'3:1': 'And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered together as [a]one man to Jerusalem.',
'3:2': 'Then [1a]Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up, along with his brothers the priests and [b]Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and his brothers, and they built the altar of the God of Israel to offer [c]burnt offerings upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the [d]man of God.',
'3:3': 'And they set up the altar upon its bases, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands; and they offered burnt offerings on it to Jehovah, burnt offerings of the [a]morning and evening.',
'3:4': 'And they held the [1a]Feast of Tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the [b]daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance as the duty of every day required;',
'3:5': 'And afterward they offered the continual burnt offering and the offerings of the [a]new moons and of all the [b]appointed feasts of Jehovah that were sanctified and of everyone who offered willingly a freewill offering to Jehovah.',
'3:6': 'From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer up burnt offerings to Jehovah;<br class="split">however the [a]foundation of the temple of Jehovah had not yet been laid.',
'3:7': 'They also gave money to the stone hewers and to the carpenters, and [a]food and drink and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring [b]cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa according to the authorization granted them by [c]Cyrus the king of Persia.',
'3:8': 'Now in the second year after they came to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, [a]Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all those who came out of captivity to Jerusalem began by appointing the Levites, from [b]twenty years old and upward, to have oversight over the work of the house of Jehovah.',
'3:9': 'Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brothers, as [a]one man, with Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, and with the sons of Henadad and their sons and their brothers the Levites, to have oversight over the workmen in the house of God.',
'3:10': 'And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of Jehovah, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the Levites, the [a]sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Jehovah according to the directions of David the king of Israel.',
'3:11': 'And they sang to one another in praising and giving thanks to Jehovah, saying, For He is good, for His lovingkindness is forever upon Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised Jehovah, because the [a]foundation of the house of Jehovah was laid.',
'3:12': 'But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers&rsquo; houses, the old men who had seen the first [a]house, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes; and many shouted aloud for joy,',
'3:13': 'So that the people could not discern the sound of the shout of joy from the sound of the weeping of the people; for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.',
'4:1': 'Now when the [1a]adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of the captivity were building a temple to Jehovah the God of Israel,',
'4:2': 'They drew near to Zerubbabel and to the heads of fathers&rsquo; houses and said to them, Let us build with you; for we seek your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon the king of [a]Assyria, who brought us up here.',
'4:3': 'But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of fathers&rsquo; houses of Israel said to them, You have [a]nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to Jehovah the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.',
'4:4': 'Then the people of the land [a]weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building.',
'4:5': 'And they hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus the king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius the king of Persia.',
'4:6': 'And in the reign of [a]Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.',
'4:7': 'And in the days of [a]Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions wrote to Artaxerxes the king of Persia; and the script of the letter was written in [b]Aramaic and translated into Aramaic.',
'4:8': '[1]Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king as follows',
'4:9': '(Then Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the judges, and the officials, the Tarpelites, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is the Elamites,',
'4:10': 'And the rest of the nations, whom the great and noble Osnappar carried into exile and settled in the city of [a]Samaria and in the rest of the province beyond the River, wrote. And now',
'4:11': 'This is the copy of the letter that they sent to him): To Artaxerxes the king, from your servants the men beyond the River. And now',
'4:12': 'Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you have come to us to Jerusalem; they are [a]rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are finishing the walls and have repaired the foundations.',
'4:13': 'Now let it be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, taxes, or tolls; and in the end it will cause damage to the kings.',
'4:14': 'Now because [1]we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king&rsquo;s dishonor, we therefore have sent this letter to inform the king,',
'4:15': 'So that a search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers, and you may find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and one that causes damage to kings and provinces and that they have stirred up sedition within it in times past; for which reason this city was laid waste.',
'4:16': 'We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, then you will have no portion beyond the River.',
'4:17': 'Then the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions who dwelt in Samaria and in the rest of the province beyond the River: Greetings. And now',
'4:18': 'The letter which you sent to us has been read before me in translation.',
'4:19': 'And a decree has been issued by me, and a search has been made; and it was found that this city in times past has risen against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it,',
'4:20': 'And that there have been mighty kings over Jerusalem, who have [a]ruled over all the lands beyond the River; and tribute, taxes and tolls were paid to them.',
'4:21': 'Now make a decree to stop these men, so that this city is not rebuilt until a decree is made by me.',
'4:22': 'And take care not to be negligent in this. Why should damage grow to the detriment of the kings?',
'4:23': 'Then when the copy of King Artaxerxes&rsquo;s letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by force and power.',
'4:24': 'So the work of the house of God, which is in Jerusalem, ceased; and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius the king of Persia.',
'5:1': 'Now the [1]prophets, [a]Haggai the prophet and [b]Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.',
'5:2': 'Then [a]Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son of Jozadak rose up and began to [b]build the house of God, which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with them, helping them.',
'5:3': 'At the same time Tattenai the governor beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and their companions came to them and spoke to them in this way, Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this wall?',
'5:4': 'Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men were who were constructing this building.',
'5:5': 'But the [a]eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them, until a report went to Darius; and then an answer was returned by letter concerning it.',
'5:6': 'This is the copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor beyond the River and Shethar-bozenai and his companions the officials, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king;',
'5:7': 'They sent a report to him in which was written as follows, To Darius the king, all peace.',
'5:8': 'Let it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is being built with large stones, and timber is being laid in the walls; and this work is being conducted with diligence and prospers in their hands.',
'5:9': 'Then we asked those elders, speaking to them in this way, Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this wall?',
'5:10': 'We also asked them their names in order to inform you, so that we might write down the names of the men who were at their head.',
'5:11': 'And they returned us an answer in this way, saying, We are the servants of the [a]God of heaven and earth and are rebuilding the [b]house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.',
'5:12': 'But because our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to anger, He gave them into the hand of [a]Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried the people away to Babylon.',
'5:13': 'But in the first year of [a]Cyrus the king of Babylon, King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.',
'5:14': 'And also the gold and silver [a]vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these King Cyrus took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one whose name was [b]Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor;',
'5:15': 'And he said to him, Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the [a]house of God be rebuilt in its place.',
'5:16': 'Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of God, which is in Jerusalem; and since that time even until now it has been under construction and has not yet been finished.',
'5:17': 'Now therefore if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the king&rsquo;s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, to see whether it is the case that a decree was made by King Cyrus for the building of this house of God in Jerusalem; and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this.',
'6:1': 'Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon.',
'6:2': 'And a scroll was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of Media, and on it this was written as a record:',
'6:3': 'In the first year of King Cyrus, King [a]Cyrus made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem: Let the house be built, the place where they offer sacrifices; and let its foundations be raised, its height being sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits,',
'6:4': 'With three layers of large stones, and one layer of timber; and let the expenses be given out of the king&rsquo;s house.',
'6:5': 'And also let the gold and silver [a]vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple which is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought again to the temple which is in Jerusalem, to its place; and you shall put them in the house of God.',
'6:6': 'Now therefore, Tattenai the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your companions the officials, in the province beyond the River, keep far away from there.',
'6:7': 'Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site.',
'6:8': 'Moreover I make a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of the Jews for the building of this house of God: From the property of the king, even the tribute of the province beyond the River, expenses are to be given in full to these men that the work not cease.',
'6:9': 'And whatever is needed, young bulls and rams and lambs, for burnt offerings to the God of heaven; also wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests who are in Jerusalem, let it be given to them day by day without fail,',
'6:10': 'That they may offer incense to the God of heaven and [a]pray for the life of the king and his sons.',
'6:11': 'Also I have made a decree that whoever alters this word, timber shall be pulled out from his house, and he shall be lifted up and impaled on it, and his house shall be made a dunghill on account of this.',
'6:12': 'And may the God who has caused His [a]name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who put forth their hand to alter this or to destroy this house of God, which is in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have made a decree; let it be carried out with all diligence.',
'6:13': 'Then Tattenai the governor beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, carried out everything with all diligence according to what Darius the king had sent order to do.',
'6:14': 'And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the [a]prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they [b]finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and according to the decree of [c]Cyrus and [d]Darius and [e]Artaxerxes the king of Persia.',
'6:15': 'And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.',
'6:16': 'And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, celebrated the [a]dedication of this house of God with joy.',
'6:17': 'And they offered for the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve male goats according to the number of the tribes of Israel.',
'6:18': 'And they set the priests in their courses and the Levites in their [a]divisions for the service of God, which is in Jerusalem, as it is written in the [b]book of Moses.',
'6:19': 'And the children of the captivity held the Passover on the [a]fourteenth day of the first month.',
'6:20': 'For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the [a]passover for all the children of the captivity and for their brothers the priests and for themselves.',
'6:21': 'And the children of Israel who returned from the captivity and all who had separated themselves from the defilement of the nations of the land to join them, to seek Jehovah the God of Israel, ate the passover',
'6:22': 'And held the [a]Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy; for Jehovah had made them joyful and had turned the [b]heart of the [1]king of Assyria to them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.',
'7:1': 'Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes the king of Persia, [1]Ezra the son of [a]Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,',
'7:2': 'The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,',
'7:3': 'The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,',
'7:4': 'The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,',
'7:5': 'The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest;',
'7:6': 'This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a [a]scribe skilled in the law of Moses, which Jehovah the God of Israel had given; and the king granted him all his [1]request according to the [2b]hand of Jehovah his God upon him.',
'7:7': 'Some of the [a]children of Israel and some of the [b]priests, and the Levites and the singers and the gatekeepers and the [c]temple servants also went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of [d]Artaxerxes the king.',
'7:8': 'And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king;',
'7:9': 'For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem according to the good [a]hand of his God upon him.',
'7:10': 'For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of Jehovah and to do it and to teach His [1]statutes and ordinances in Israel.',
'7:11': 'Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commandments of Jehovah and of His statutes for Israel:',
'7:12': '[1]Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace. And now',
'7:13': 'I make a decree that any of the people of Israel and their priests and the Levites in my kingdom who offer themselves willingly to go to Jerusalem may go with you.',
'7:14': 'Inasmuch as you have been sent by the king and his [a]seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the law of your God, which is in your hand,',
'7:15': 'And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counselors have offered willingly to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,',
'7:16': 'As well as all the silver and gold that you shall find in the whole province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people and the priests, who offered willingly for the house of their God, which is in Jerusalem;',
'7:17': 'With this money therefore you shall with all diligence buy bulls, rams, lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings; and you shall offer them on the altar of the house of your God, which is in Jerusalem.',
'7:18': 'And whatever seems good to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, you may do according to the will of your God.',
'7:19': 'And the vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver in full before the God of Jerusalem.',
'7:20': 'And the rest of the needs for the house of your God, which you have occasion to provide, you may provide for it out of the king&rsquo;s treasure house.',
'7:21': 'And I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, make a decree to all the treasurers who are in the province beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence,',
'7:22': 'Up to one hundred talents of silver and up to one hundred cors of wheat and up to one hundred baths of wine and up to one hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much.',
'7:23': 'Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of heaven. For why should wrath come upon the kingdom of the king and his sons?',
'7:24': 'We also inform you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, taxes, or tolls upon any of the priests and Levites, the singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or servants of this house of God.',
'7:25': 'And you, Ezra, according to the [a]wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges, who may judge all the people who are in the province beyond the River, all those who know the laws of your God; and teach anyone who does not know them.',

'8:17': 'And I sent them to Iddo the leading man at the place Casiphia; and I told them what to say to Iddo and his brothers the temple servants at the place Casiphia, namely, to bring ministers to us for the house of our God.',
'8:18': 'And according to the good [a]hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; namely, Sherebiah, with his sons and his brothers, eighteen men;',
'8:19': 'And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brothers and their sons, twenty;',
'8:20': 'And of the [a]temple servants, whom David and the leaders had given for the service of the Levites, two hundred twenty temple servants&mdash;all of them were mentioned by name.',
'8:21': 'Then I proclaimed a [a]fast there, at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God to seek from Him a straight way for ourselves and for our little ones and for all our possessions.',
'8:22': 'For I was ashamed to ask for troops and horsemen from the king to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken to the king, saying, The [a]hand of our God is for good upon all those who seek Him, but His power and His wrath is against all those who forsake Him.',
'8:23': 'So we fasted and sought our God for this, and He was entreated by us.',
'8:24': 'Then I set apart twelve of the leading men of the priests, even Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,',
'8:25': 'And weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the [1]heave offering for the house of our God, which the king and his counselors and his princes, and all Israel there present had offered.',
'8:26': 'I weighed out into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver and one hundred silver vessels of one hundred talents, one hundred talents of gold',
'8:27': 'And twenty bowls of gold of one thousand darics, and two vessels of fine polished bronze as precious as gold.',
'8:28': 'And I said to them, You are [a]holy to Jehovah, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to Jehovah, the God of your fathers.',
'8:29': 'Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the leaders of the priests and the Levites and the leaders of the fathers&rsquo; houses of Israel at Jerusalem in the chambers of the house of Jehovah.',
'8:30': 'So the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.',
'8:31': 'Then we set out from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the [a]hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from people set in ambush on the way.',
'8:32': 'And we came to [a]Jerusalem and remained there three days.',
'8:33': 'And on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed out in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them were the Levites, Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui.',
'8:34': 'Everything was numbered and weighed, and all its weight was recorded at that time.',
'8:35': 'The children of those who had been carried away, who [a]came out of captivity, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve male goats for a sin offering, all as a burnt offering to Jehovah.',
'8:36': 'And they delivered the king&rsquo;s decrees to the king&rsquo;s satraps and to the governors beyond the River, and these supported the people and the house of God.',
'9:1': 'Now when these things had been completed, the officials approached me, saying, The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have [a]not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even those of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.',
'9:2': 'For they have taken some of their [1]daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the [a]holy seed have [b]mingled themselves with the peoples of the lands; indeed, the hand of the leaders and rulers has been foremost in this unfaithfulness.',
'9:3': 'And when I heard about this matter, I tore my garment and my robe, and pulled out hair from my head and my beard, and sat down appalled.',
'9:4': 'Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel on account of the unfaithfulness of those of the captivity was gathered to me, and I sat appalled until the evening meal offering.',
'9:5': 'And at the time of the evening meal offering I rose up from my affliction, even with my garment and my robe torn, and I fell on my knees and [a]spread out my hands to Jehovah my God.',
'9:6': 'And I said, O my God, I am ashamed and [a]embarrassed to lift up my face to You, my God; for our [b]iniquities have multiplied over our head, and our guilt has increased up to the heavens.',
'9:7': 'Since the days of our fathers up to this day we have been exceedingly guilty; and because of our iniquities we, our kings and our priests, have been delivered up into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to plunder, and to shamefacedness, as it is this day.',
'9:8': 'And now for a brief moment favor has been shown by Jehovah our God to leave us a [a]remnant to escape and to give us a [b]peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.',
'9:9': 'For we are slaves, yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to raise up the [a]house of our God and to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.',
'9:10': 'And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,',
'9:11': 'Which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, The land which you are entering to possess is a land unclean with the uncleanness of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations, with which they have filled it from one end to another, and with their defilement.',
'9:12': 'Now therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, neither [a]take their daughters for your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever; that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children forever.',
'9:13': 'And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that You our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us those who have escaped as this,',
'9:14': 'Shall we again break your commandments and intermarry with the peoples that do these abominations? Will You not be angry with us until You have consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor any who escape?',
'9:15': 'O Jehovah the God of Israel, You are righteous; for we have been left a [a]remnant of those who have escaped, as it is this day. Here we are before You in our guilt, although none can stand before You because of this.',
'10:1': 'Now while Ezra [a]prayed and made confession, weeping and throwing himself down before the [b]house of God, a very large gathering of men and women and children was gathered together to him out of Israel; for the people wept very bitterly.',
'10:2': 'And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, We have acted unfaithfully against our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this.',
'10:3': 'Now therefore let us make a [a]covenant with our God to put away all the wives and those born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the law.',
'10:4': 'Arise, for the matter is your responsibility, but we are with you; be strong, and do it.',
'10:5': 'Then Ezra arose and made the leaders of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear that they would do according to this word; so they swore.',
'10:6': 'Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib; and when he came there, he [a]ate no bread and drank no water, for he was mourning because of the unfaithfulness of those of the captivity.',
'10:7': 'And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together to Jerusalem;',
'10:8': 'And that whoever did not come within three days, according to the counsel of the leaders and the elders, all his possessions should be forfeited, and he himself should be separated from the congregation of the captivity.',
'10:9': 'Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within the three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month, and all the people sat in the open square in front of the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.',
'10:10': 'And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, You have acted unfaithfully and have married foreign women to increase the guilt of Israel.',
'10:11': 'Now therefore make confession to Jehovah the God of your fathers, and do His will, and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women.',
'10:12': 'Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, It is so; we must do as you have said.',
'10:13': 'But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain, and we are not able to stand outside; neither is this a task for one day or two, for we have transgressed greatly in this matter.',
'10:14': 'Let our leaders represent the whole congregation, and let all those who are in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and their judges, until the fierce anger of our God is turned away from us on account of this matter.',
'10:15': 'Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.',
'10:16': 'And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest and certain heads of fathers&rsquo; houses were set apart according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, all of them by name; and they sat down on the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.',
'10:17': 'And they finished with all the men who had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.',
'10:18': 'And among the sons of the priests who had married foreign women there were found of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah and Eliezer and Jarib and Gedaliah.',
'10:19': 'And they [a]pledged that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a [b]ram of the flock for their guilt.',

{sup:"1a", word:"Now", vrefs:"vv. 1-3: 2&nbsp;Chron. 36:22-23", lines:["Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther, the last three books of the history of God&rsquo;s chosen people in the Old Testament, are related to God&rsquo;s chosen people in their captivity ({2Ch36:17|2&nbsp;Chron. 36:17}-{2Ch36:21|21}). Ezra concerns the return of God&rsquo;s people from their captivity (cf. Daniel, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi) to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple, and Nehemiah concerns the repair, the rebuilding, of the city. Esther presents to us a pattern of how the omnipresent and omnipotent God becomes the hiding God who secretly preserves and cares for His chosen people in their captivity.","The book of Ezra provides a record of the two returns of the children of Israel from their captivity, which fulfilled God&rsquo;s promise, spoken through Jeremiah, that the captivity would last only seventy years ({Jer25:11|Jer. 25:11}-{Jer25:12|12}; {Jer29:10|29:10}; {2Ch36:21|2&nbsp;Chron. 36:21}-{2Ch36:22|22}; {Dan9:2|Dan. 9:2}). The first return was under the kingly leadership of Zerubbabel (chs. {Ezr1|1}&mdash;{Ezr6|6}), a descendant of the royal family of David who was appointed to be the governor of Judah by Cyrus ({Ezr5:14|5:14}; cf. {Ezr1:8^1|note 8<sup>1</sup>}). The second return was under the priestly leadership of Ezra (chs. {Ezr7|7}&mdash;{Ezr10|10}).","The return of Israel to Jerusalem from their captivity was crucial in four points: (1) it recovered the purpose of God&rsquo;s calling Israel to make them His testimony according to His law (see {Exo20:1^1|note 1<sup>1</sup>} in {Exo20|Exo. 20}); (2) it recovered the oneness of Israel on the unique ground of Jerusalem ({Deu12:5|Deut. 12:5}, {Deu12:11|11}-{Deu12:14|14}); (3) it recovered Israel&rsquo;s enjoyment of the good land promised by God; and (4) it allowed God to fulfill His intention of having His house built and His kingdom established on the Satan-usurped earth in order to carry out His eternal economy through Israel&rsquo;s participation in and enjoyment of the good land. All the foregoing crucial points typify today&rsquo;s recovery of the church life, which is a recovery of the church out of captivity in the great Babylon ({Rev17:1|Rev. 17:1}-{Rev17:6|6}) back to the unique ground of God&rsquo;s choice, the ground of oneness."]},

The stirring up of the spirit of Cyrus and the spirits of the leaders of the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi ({Ezr1:5|v. 5}) was a work of the hiding God (see {Est1:1^1P1|note 1<sup>1</sup>, par. 1}, in {Est1|Esth. 1}) for His move to rebuild His house in Jerusalem."]},

In God&rsquo;s theocratic administration among the people of Israel, there were three offices: the priests, the kings, and the prophets. The responsibility of the high priest was to bring the matters concerning God&rsquo;s people into God&rsquo;s presence and wait on God for His instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim ({Exo28:30|Exo. 28:30} and {Exo28:30^1|notes}). The high priest then passed on God&rsquo;s decision and instructions to the king, who was responsible in God&rsquo;s administration to carry them out. Whenever the priests and the kings became weak and inadequate, God raised up the prophets to speak for Him in order to strengthen and assist the priesthood and the kingship ({1Sa3:11|1&nbsp;Sam. 3:11}-{1Sa3:21|21}; {2Sa12:1|2&nbsp;Sam. 12:1}-{2Sa12:25|25}).

The tabernacle was raised up through Aaron, the high priest, and Moses, representing the divine authority; the temple was built under the high priest and Solomon the king; the rebuilding of the temple was accomplished through the priesthood of Joshua and the authority of Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah ({Hag1:1|Hag. 1:1}). In the building of the recovered temple both Joshua and Zerubbabel became somewhat weak and discouraged. Therefore, God used the prophets Haggai and Zechariah to speak for Him and to strengthen and encourage Joshua and Zerubbabel (see the books of Haggai and Zechariah).","In God&rsquo;s economy the priesthood and the kingship will remain forever ({Rev22:3|Rev. 22:3}, {Rev22:5|5}), whereas in the age of the millennium and in eternity the prophethood will not be needed ({Dan9:24|Dan. 9:24} and {Dan9:24^4|note 4})."]},

After this, the need shifted from the royal family to the priesthood, to Ezra, a descendant of the high priest Aaron (vv. {Ezr7:1|1}-{Ezr7:5|5}).
