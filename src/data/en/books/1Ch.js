'11:14': 'But they stationed themselves in the midst of the plot and delivered it and struck the Philistines, and Jehovah accomplished a great salvation.',
'11:15': 'Now three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David in the cave of Adullam while the army of the Philistines was encamped in the valley of Rephaim.',
'11:16': 'Now at that time David was in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem at that time.',
'11:17': 'And David said longingly, If only someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!',
'11:18': 'And the three burst through the camp of the Philistines and drew water from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate. And they carried it and brought it to David, but David would not drink it; rather he poured it out to Jehovah.',
'11:19': 'And he said, Far be it from me, before my God, that I should do this! Shall I drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives? For at the risk of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.',
'11:20': 'And Abishai the brother of Joab was chief of the three. And he brandished his spear against three hundred, who were slain; and he had a name among the three.',
'11:21': 'He was indeed honored among the two of the [1]thirty, and he became their leader; but he did not attain to the three.',
'11:22': 'And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man from Kabzeel, was great in mighty deeds. He struck the two sons of Ariel the Moabite; he also went down and struck a lion in the midst of a pit on a snowy day.',
'11:23': 'And he struck an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits tall. And the Egyptian had a spear in his hand like a weaver&rsquo;s beam, but he went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian and slew him with his own spear.',
'11:24': 'These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and he had a name among the three mighty men.',
'11:25': 'He was indeed more honored than the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.',

'12:18': 'Then the Spirit [1]came upon Amasai, the head of the thirty, and he said,<br>We are yours, O David,<br>And are with you, O son of Jesse.<br>Peace, peace be with you,<br>And peace with those who help you;<br>For your God helps you.<br>And David received them and made them heads of the troops.',
'12:19': 'And some from Manasseh fell away to David when he came with the Philistines for battle against Saul. (But they did not help them, for the lords of the Philistines, upon deliberation, sent him away, saying, He will fall back to his master Saul at the cost of our heads.)',

'13:3': 'And let us bring back the [a]Ark of our God to ourselves, for we did not inquire of it in the days of Saul.',
'13:4': 'And all the congregation said that they would do so, for the matter was right in the sight of all the people.',

'13:6': '[a]And David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which is Judah&rsquo;s, to bring up from there the Ark of God, of Jehovah, who is enthroned between the cherubim, which is called by the Name;',
'13:7': 'And they set the Ark of God upon a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart.',
'13:8': 'And David and all Israel played before God with all their strength, even with songs and with lyres and with harps and with tambourines and with cymbals and with trumpets.',
'13:9': 'And when they came to Chidon&rsquo;s threshing floor, Uzzah stretched out his hand to take hold of the Ark; for the oxen had stumbled.',
'13:10': 'And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Uzzah, and He struck him because he stretched out his hand [a]to the Ark; and he died there before God.',
'13:11': 'And David was angry because Jehovah had broken forth with an outburst upon Uzzah, and he called that place Perez-uzzah, as it is to this day.',
'13:12': 'And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the Ark of God to myself?',
'13:13': 'So David did not remove the Ark to himself to the city of David, but he carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.',
'13:14': 'And the Ark of God remained with the house of Obed-edom in his house three months, and Jehovah blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that he had.',
'14:1': '[a]And Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, as well as cedar timbers and masons and carpenters to build a house for him.',
'14:2': 'And David perceived that Jehovah had established him as king over Israel and that his kingdom was highly exalted for the sake of His people Israel.',

'14:8': 'Now when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard of it and went out against them.',
'14:9': 'And the Philistines came and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.',
'14:10': 'Then David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up, and I will deliver them into your hand.',
'14:11': 'And they went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them there. And David said, God has broken forth upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of a flood. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.',
'14:12': 'And they left their gods there; and David gave the order, and they were [a]burned with fire.',
'14:13': 'And the Philistines made yet another raid in the valley.',
'14:14': 'And David inquired again of God, and God said to him, You shall not go up after them; go around behind them, and come upon them opposite the balsam trees.',
'14:15': 'And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall go out to battle; for God will have gone forth before you to strike the [1]army of the Philistines.',
'14:16': 'And David did as God had commanded him, and they struck down the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even unto Gezer.',
'14:17': 'And David&rsquo;s fame went forth among all the lands, and Jehovah put the fear of him upon all the nations.',
'15:1': 'And David made houses for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the Ark of God and pitched a [a]tent for it.',
'15:2': 'Then David said, None should bear the Ark of God except the Levites, for Jehovah has chosen them to [a]bear the Ark of Jehovah and to minister to Him forever.',
'15:3': 'So David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem in order to bring up the [1]Ark of Jehovah to its place, which he had prepared for it.',
'15:4': 'And David gathered the sons of Aaron and the Levites:',
'15:5': 'Of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the leader, and his brothers, one hundred twenty;',
'15:6': 'Of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the leader, and his brothers, two hundred twenty;',
'15:7': 'Of the sons of Gershom, Joel the leader, and his brothers, one hundred thirty;',
'15:8': 'Of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the leader, and his brothers, two hundred;',
'15:9': 'Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the leader, and his brothers, eighty;',
'15:10': 'Of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the leader, and his brothers, one hundred twelve.',
'15:11': 'And David called for [a]Zadok and [b]Abiathar the priests and the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah and Joel, Shemaiah and Eliel and Amminadab;',
'15:12': 'And he said to them, You are the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, you and your brothers, and bring up the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel to the place that I have prepared for it.',
'15:13': 'For because you did not bring it up the first time, Jehovah our God [a]broke forth upon us; for we did not seek Him according to the ordinance.',
'15:14': 'So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves in order to bring up the Ark of Jehovah the God of Israel.',
'15:15': 'And the sons of the Levites bore the Ark of God as Moses had commanded, according to the word of Jehovah, upon their shoulders with the [a]poles upon them.',
'15:16': 'And David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers with musical instruments&mdash;harps, lyres, loud-sounding cymbals&mdash;to raise sounds of joy.',
'15:17': 'So the Levites appointed [a]Heman the son of Joel; and of his brothers, [b]Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brothers, [c]Ethan the son of Kushaiah;',
'15:18': 'And with them their brothers of the second order: Zechariah, [1]and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni, Eliab and Benaiah and Maaseiah and Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.',
'15:19': 'So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound aloud with bronze cymbals;',
'15:20': 'And Zechariah and Aziel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Unni and Eliab and Maaseiah and Benaiah with harps set to [1]alamoth;',
'15:21': 'And Mattithiah and Eliphelehu and Mikneiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel and Azaziah were appointed to lead with lyres set to [1]sheminith.',
'15:22': 'And Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites, was over the song; he instructed about the song, because he was skillful.',
'15:23': 'And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the Ark.',
'15:24': 'And Shebaniah and Joshaphat and Nethanel and Amasai and Zechariah and Benaiah and Eliezer, the priests, blew the [a]trumpets before the Ark of God; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the Ark.',
'15:25': '[a]So David and the elders of Israel and the captains of thousands went to bring up the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah from the house of Obed-edom with rejoicing.',
'15:26': 'And because God helped the Levites who bore the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.',
'15:27': 'And David was clothed with a fine linen robe, as were all the Levites who bore the Ark and the singers and Chenaniah, the song leader of the singers; and David had on a linen [a]ephod.',
'15:28': 'So all Israel brought up the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah with shouting and with the sound of the horn and with trumpets and with cymbals, sounding aloud with harps and lyres.',
'15:29': 'And when the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through a window and saw King David dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.',
'16:1': 'And they brought the Ark of God and set it in the midst of the [a]tent that David had pitched for it. And they offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings before God.',
'16:2': 'And when David finished offering up the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.',
'16:3': 'And he apportioned to everyone of Israel, to both men and women, to each one, a cake of bread and a [1]portion of meat and a cake of raisins.',
'16:4': 'And he [a]appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the Ark of Jehovah and to commemorate and thank and praise Jehovah the God of Israel:',
'16:5': 'Asaph the chief; and second to him Zechariah; Jeiel and Shemiramoth and Jehiel and Mattithiah and Eliab and Benaiah and Obed-edom and Jeiel, with harps and with lyres; and Asaph sounding aloud with cymbals;',
'16:6': 'And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the Ark of the Covenant of God.',
'16:7': 'On that day, at that time, David first ordained the giving of thanks to Jehovah by the hand of [a]Asaph and his brothers.',
'16:8': '[a]Give thanks to Jehovah; [b]call upon His name;<br>Make known His deeds among the peoples.',

'16:18': 'Saying, To you I will [a]give the land of Canaan,<br>The portion of your inheritance;',
'16:19': 'When you were men [a]few in number,<br>Indeed very few and [b]strangers in [1]the land;',
'16:20': 'And they [a]went about from nation to nation,<br>And from one kingdom to another people.',
'16:21': 'He allowed no man to oppress them;<br>Indeed He [a]rebuked kings for their sake.',
'16:22': 'Saying, Do not touch My anointed ones,<br>And do My [a]prophets no harm.',

'16:24': 'Declare His glory among the nations,<br>His wondrous deeds among all the peoples.',
'16:25': 'For Jehovah is great and much to be praised,<br>And He is to be feared above all gods.',
'16:26': 'For all the gods of the peoples are [a]idols,<br>But Jehovah made the heavens.',
'16:27': 'Majesty and splendor are before Him;<br>Strength and gladness are in His place.',
'16:28': 'Ascribe to Jehovah, O families of the peoples,<br>Ascribe to Jehovah, glory and strength;',

'16:36': 'Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel,<br>From eternity to eternity.<br>And all the people said, [a]Amen, and praised Jehovah.',
'16:37': 'So there before the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah he [a]left Asaph and his brothers to minister before the Ark continually, as every day&rsquo;s work dictated;',

'17:2': 'And Nathan said to David, All that is in your heart do, for God is with you.',
'17:3': 'And in that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,',
'17:4': 'Go and say to David My servant, Thus says Jehovah, It will not be you who [a]builds Me a house to dwell in.',

'17:7': 'And now thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says Jehovah of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, that you might be ruler over My people Israel;',
'17:8': 'And I have been with you in every place that you have gone and have cut off all your enemies before you; and I will make a name for you, like the name of the great ones who are on the earth.',

'17:15': 'According to all these words and according to this whole vision did Nathan speak to David.',
'17:16': 'Then King David went and sat before Jehovah; and he said, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what is my house that You have brought me this far?',
'17:17': 'And this was a small thing in Your sight, O God; but You have spoken of the house of Your servant for a great while to come; and You have regarded me according to the custom for a man of high degree, O Jehovah God.',
'17:18': 'What more can David add to say to You concerning this honoring of Your servant? For You know Your servant.',

'17:24': 'And may Your name be established and magnified forever when men say, Jehovah of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel; and the house of David Your servant will be established before You.',
'17:25': 'For You, O my God, have revealed to Your servant, that You will build him a [a]house; therefore Your servant has found it in his heart to pray before You.',
'17:26': 'And now, O Jehovah, You are God, and You have spoken this good matter concerning Your servant;',
'17:27': 'Now therefore You have been pleased to bless the house of Your servant, that it may be before You forever; for You, O Jehovah, have blessed, and it is blessed forever.',
'18:1': '[a]And after this David struck the Philistines and subdued them. And David took Gath and her villages out of the hand of the Philistines.',
'18:2': 'And he struck Moab, and the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.',
'18:3': 'Then David struck Hadadezer the king of Zobah at Hamath, when he went to establish his power at the river Euphrates.',
'18:4': 'And David took from him one thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand foot soldiers. And David hamstrung all the chariot horses but left enough of them for a hundred chariots.',
'18:5': 'And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadadezer the king of Zobah, David struck twenty-two thousand men among the Syrians.',
'18:6': 'And David put garrisons among the Syrians of Damascus, and the Syrians became servants to David and brought tribute. And Jehovah preserved David wherever he went.',
'18:7': 'And David took the [1]shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.',
'18:8': 'And from Tibhath and Cun, cities of Hadadezer, David took very much bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze sea and the pillars and the vessels of bronze.',
'18:9': 'Then when Tou the king of Hamath heard that David had struck down all the army of Hadadezer the king of Zobah,',
'18:10': 'He sent Hadoram his son to King David to greet him and congratulate him for fighting against Hadadezer and striking him down, for Hadadezer had been at war with Tou. And Hadoram brought all kinds of articles of gold and of silver and of bronze.',
'18:11': 'King David [a]consecrated these also to Jehovah along with the silver and gold that he had carried from all the nations: from the Edomites and from the Moabites and from the children of Ammon and from the Philistines and from the Amalekites.',
'18:12': 'Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah struck down the Edomites in the Valley of Salt, that is, eighteen thousand men.',
'18:13': 'And he put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And Jehovah preserved David wherever he went.',
'18:14': 'So David reigned over all Israel and executed justice and righteousness for all his people.',
'18:15': 'And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder.',
'18:16': 'And Zadok the son of Ahitub and Abimelech the son of Abiathar were priests, and Shavsha was scribe.',
'18:17': 'And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David&rsquo;s sons were chief at the king&rsquo;s side.',
'19:1': '[a]And after this Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his place.',
'19:2': 'And David said, I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. And David&rsquo;s servants came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun to comfort him.',
'19:3': 'But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Do you really think that David is honoring your father just because he sent to you some men to comfort you? Have not his servants come to you in order to search out and to overthrow and to spy on the land?',
'19:4': 'So Hanun took David&rsquo;s servants and shaved them and cut away half their garments at the hips, and he sent them away.',
'19:5': 'Now when they went and told David about the men, he sent some to meet them, for the men were very ashamed. And the king said, Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back, then return.',
'19:6': 'And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent one thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia and from the Syrians of Maacah and from Zobah.',
'19:7': 'So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered together from their cities and came to the battle.',
'19:8': 'And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of mighty men.',
'19:9': 'And the children of Ammon went forth and set the battle in array at the entrance of the city, but the kings who had come were alone in the field.',
'19:10': 'Now when Joab saw that there were battle lines against him before and behind, he chose some of the choice men in Israel and set them in array against the Syrians.',
'19:11': 'And the rest of the people he put under the charge of Abishai his brother, and they arrayed themselves against the children of Ammon.',
'19:12': 'And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you shall help me; and if the children of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.',
'19:13': 'Be strong and let us be bold for the sake of our people and for the sake of the cities of our God, and may Jehovah do what seems good in His sight.',
'19:14': 'So Joab and the people who were with him approached the battle against the Syrians, and [1]the Syrians fled before him.',
'19:15': 'And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians fled, and they also fled from before Abishai his brother and entered the city. And Joab entered Jerusalem.',
'19:16': 'Now when the Syrians saw that they had been routed before Israel, they sent messengers and brought forth the Syrians who were beyond the [1]River with Shophach the captain of the army of Hadadezer before them.',
'19:17': 'And it was told David, and he gathered all Israel together and passed over the Jordan and came to them and set his men in array against them. When David set his men in array to meet the Syrians in battle, they fought with him.',
'19:18': 'And the Syrians fled before Israel. And David slew seven thousand charioteers of the Syrians and forty thousand footmen, and he put Shophach the captain of the army to death.',
'19:19': 'And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had been routed before Israel, they made peace with David and served him. So the Syrians were not willing to help the children of Ammon any more.',
'20:1': '[a]Then at the time of the turn of the year, at the time when kings go forth to battle, Joab led the army and devastated the land of the children of Ammon. And he went and besieged Rabbah while David remained in Jerusalem. And Joab struck Rabbah and overthrew it.',
'20:2': 'And David took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and in it were precious stones; and it was put upon David&rsquo;s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.',
'20:3': 'And he brought out the people who were in it and hewed them with saws and iron cutting tools and axes, and thus did David do to all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.',
'20:4': '[a]Then after this a war arose with the Philistines at Gezer; and Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, one of the children of the giants; and they were subdued.',
'20:5': 'And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of [a]Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver&rsquo;s beam.',
'20:6': 'And again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all; and he also had been born to the giant.',
'20:7': 'And he defied Israel; and Jonathan the son of Shimea, David&rsquo;s brother, slew him.',
'20:8': 'These had been born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hands of his servants.',
'21:1': '[a]And [b]Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel.',
'21:2': 'And David said to Joab and to the captains of the people, Go and count Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring the results to me, that I may know their number.',
'21:3': 'And Joab said, May Jehovah add to His people a hundred times as many as they are. But, O my lord the king, are they not all my lord&rsquo;s servants? Why does my lord request this? Why should he become a cause of guilt to Israel?',
'21:4': 'Nevertheless the king&rsquo;s word prevailed over Joab, and Joab went forth and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.',
'21:5': 'And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. And all Israel were one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah was four hundred seventy thousand men who drew the sword.',
'21:6': 'But he did [a]not number Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king&rsquo;s word was abhorrent to Joab.',
'21:7': 'And this matter displeased God, and He struck Israel.',
'21:8': 'And David said to God, I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing; but now put away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.',
'21:9': 'And Jehovah spoke to Gad, David&rsquo;s seer, saying,',
'21:10': 'Go and speak to David, saying, Thus says Jehovah, I am offering you three things; choose for yourself one of them, that I may do it to you.',
'21:11': 'So Gad went to David and said to him, Thus says Jehovah, Take for yourself',
'21:12': 'Either three years of famine, or three months to be swept away before your adversaries, while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days of the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the territory of Israel. And now see what word I should return to Him who sent me.',
'21:13': 'And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait; let me fall into the hand of Jehovah, for His [a]compassions are very great; and do not let me fall into the hand of man.',
'21:14': 'So Jehovah sent a pestilence in Israel, and seventy thousand people of Israel fell.',
'21:15': 'And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but as he was destroying it, Jehovah saw and [a]repented of the harm. And He said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now hold back your hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.',
'21:16': 'And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between the earth and the heavens, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces.',
'21:17': 'And David said to God, Was it not I who ordered the numbering of the people? And it is I who have sinned and acted very wickedly. But these [a]sheep, what have they done? O Jehovah my God, let Your hand, I pray, be against me and against the house of my father, but not against Your people that they should be plagued.',
'21:18': 'And the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to tell David that David should go up and raise up an altar to Jehovah on the [1a]threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.',
'21:19': 'And David went up at Gad&rsquo;s word, which he spoke in the name of Jehovah.',
'21:20': 'And Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves; and Ornan was threshing wheat.',
'21:21': 'And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David. And he went forth from the threshing floor and bowed down to David with his face to the ground.',
'21:22': 'And David said to Ornan, Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to Jehovah. For the full price you shall give it to me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.',
'21:23': 'And Ornan said to David, Take it; and may my lord the king do whatever seems good in his sight. Look, I have given the oxen for the burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for the wood and the wheat for the meal offering&mdash;all this I give.',
'21:24': 'But King David said to Ornan, No; but I will surely buy it for the full price, for I will not take what is yours for Jehovah and offer up burnt offerings that cost me nothing.',
'21:25': 'So David gave to Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site.',
'21:26': 'And there David built an altar to Jehovah, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called on Jehovah, and He answered him with [a]fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.',
'21:27': 'And Jehovah commanded the angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.',
'21:28': 'At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.',
'21:29': 'And the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering at that time were in the high place at [a]Gibeon.',
'21:30': 'And David was not able to go before it to inquire of God because he was terrified of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.',
'22:1': 'Then David said, This is the [a]house of Jehovah God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.',
'22:2': '[1]And David ordered the gathering of the sojourners who were in the land of Israel. And he appointed masons to hew the wrought stones for the building of the house of God.',
'22:3': 'And David [1a]prepared iron in abundance for the nails of the doors of the gates and for the clasps; and bronze in abundance, without weight;',
'22:4': 'And cedar trees without number, for the Sidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar trees in vast quantity to David.',
'22:5': 'And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be built to Jehovah must be exceedingly great in fame and glory throughout all lands; I will therefore make preparations for it. So David prepared an abundance before his death.',
'22:6': 'Then he called for Solomon his son and commanded him to build a house for Jehovah the God of Israel.',
'22:7': 'And David said to [1]Solomon, My son, as for me, it was on my [a]heart to build a house for the name of Jehovah my God.',
'22:8': 'But the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly and have waged great wars. You shall [a]not build a house for My name, for you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.',
'22:9': 'Behold, a son will be born to you. He will be a man of [1]rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies around him, for [a]Solomon will be his name, and I will give [b]peace and quiet to Israel throughout his days.',
'22:10': 'It is [1]he who will [a]build a house for My name; and he will be My son, and I will be his [b]Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.',
'22:11': 'Now, my son, may Jehovah be with you; and may you prosper and [a]build the house of Jehovah your God, as He has spoken concerning you.',
'22:12': 'Only, let Jehovah give you [a]insight and understanding, and let Him give you charge over Israel that you may keep the law of Jehovah your God;',
'22:13': 'Then you will prosper if you are certain to perform the statutes and ordinances with which Jehovah charged Moses concerning Israel. Be strong and be bold; do not be afraid or dismayed.',
'22:14': 'Now then in my affliction I have prepared for the house of Jehovah one hundred thousand talents of gold and one million talents of silver and bronze and iron without weight, for it is in abundance; and timber and stone I have prepared; and you may add to these.',
'22:15': 'And with you there are workmen in abundance, masons and workers in stone and wood and all manner of men who are skillful in every kind of work.',
'22:16': 'To the gold and silver and bronze and iron there is no number. Arise and do it, and may Jehovah be with you.',
'22:17': 'And David commanded all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,',
'22:18': 'Indeed Jehovah your God is with you. And He has given you [a]rest all around. For He has given the inhabitants of the land into my hand, and the land has been subdued before Jehovah and before His people.',
'22:19': 'Now set your heart and your soul to seek after Jehovah your God; and arise and build the sanctuary of Jehovah God, in order to bring the [a]Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah and all the holy vessels of God to the house that is to be built for the name of Jehovah.',
'23:1': 'Now when David was old and full of days, he made [a]Solomon his son king over Israel.',
'23:2': 'And he gathered all the leaders of Israel and the [1]priests and the [1]Levites.',
'23:3': 'And the Levites were numbered from [1a]thirty years old and upward; and their number, head by head and man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.',
'23:4': 'Of these twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah, and six thousand were officers and judges,',
'23:5': 'And four thousand were gatekeepers, and four thousand were to praise Jehovah with the instruments that I have made for praising, said David.',
'23:6': 'And David formed them into [a]divisions according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.',
'23:7': '[a]Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.',
'23:8': 'The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief and Zetham and Joel, three.',
'23:9': 'The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth and Haziel and Haran, three. These were the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of Ladan.',
'23:10': 'And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.',
'23:11': 'And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons; therefore they became a father&rsquo;s house in one reckoning.',
'23:12': '[a]The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.',
'23:13': 'The sons of [a]Amram: Aaron and Moses; and [b]Aaron was separated that he might sanctify the most holy things forever, he and his sons, by burning [c]incense before Jehovah, by ministering to Him, and by blessing in His name forever.',
'23:14': 'And as for Moses the [a]man of God, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.',
'23:15': 'The sons of Moses: [a]Gershom and Eliezer.',
'23:16': 'The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.',
'23:17': 'And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.',
'23:18': 'The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.',
'23:19': 'The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.',
'23:20': 'The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief and Isshiah the second.',
'23:21': '[a]The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.',
'23:22': 'And Eleazar died and had no sons, only daughters; and their brothers the sons of Kish took them as their wives.',
'23:23': 'The sons of Mushi: Mahli and Eder and Jeremoth, three.',
'23:24': 'These were the sons of Levi according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of those who had been counted, by the number of names, head by head, who did the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from [a]twenty years old and upward.',
'23:25': 'For David said, Jehovah the God of Israel has given [a]rest to His people, and He will dwell in Jerusalem forever;',
'23:26': 'And also the Levites need not [a]carry the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service.',
'23:27': 'For by the last words of David the sons of Levi were numbered from twenty years and upward.',
'23:28': 'For their station was alongside the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of Jehovah in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all the holy things, that is, the work of the service of the house of God;',
'23:29': 'And for the rows of [a]bread and the fine flour of the meal offering and the unleavened wafers and what is baked in the pan and what is mixed with oil and all measures of quantity and size;',
'23:30': 'And to stand morning by morning to thank and praise Jehovah, and likewise in the evening;',
'23:31': 'And to offer all the burnt offerings to Jehovah, according to the number ordained for them, on the [a]Sabbaths, at the [1]new moons, and on the appointed feasts, continually before Jehovah;',
'23:32': 'And they were to keep the charge of the [a]Tent of Meeting and the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the sons of Aaron their brothers for the [b]service of the house of Jehovah.',
'24:1': 'And the divisions of the sons of Aaron were these: the sons of Aaron: [a]Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.',
'24:2': 'But [1]Nadab and Abihu [a]died before their father and had no children; therefore Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests.',
'24:3': 'And David with [a]Zadok of the sons of Eleazar and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar divided them according to their offices in their service.',
'24:4': 'Since more chief men were found among the sons of Eleazar than the sons of Ithamar, they were divided thus: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers&rsquo; houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers&rsquo; houses, eight.',
'24:5': 'And they were divided by lot, each like the others; for there were officers of the sanctuary and officers of God, both from the sons of Eleazar and from the sons of Ithamar.',
'24:6': 'And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, from among the Levites, recorded them in the presence of the king and the leaders and Zadok the priest and Ahimelech the son of [a]Abiathar and the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the priests and of the Levites, one fathers&rsquo; house being drawn for Eleazar and one drawn for Ithamar.',
'24:7': 'Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,',

'24:18': 'The twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.',
'24:19': 'These were their offices in their service for coming into the house of Jehovah according to the [a]arrangement given to them by Aaron their father, as Jehovah the God of Israel had commanded him.',
'24:20': 'And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of Amram, Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.',
'24:21': 'Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.',

'24:29': 'Of Kish: the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.',
'24:30': 'And the sons of Mushi: Mahli and Eder and Jerimoth. These were the sons of the Levites according to their fathers&rsquo; houses.',
'24:31': 'These likewise [a]cast lots even as their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king and Zadok and Ahimelech and the heads of the fathers&rsquo; houses of the priests and of the Levites, the head of the fathers&rsquo; houses even as his younger brother.',
'25:1': 'Moreover David and the leaders of the army set apart for the service some of the sons of [a]Asaph and [1b]Heman and [c]Jeduthun to [d]prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals. And the list of those who did the work according to their service was:',
'25:2': 'Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur and Joseph and Nethaniah and Asharelah, the sons of Asaph, under the hand of Asaph, who prophesied under the king&rsquo;s direction.',
'25:3': 'Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah and Zeri and Jeshaiah [1]and Shimei and Hashabiah and Mattithiah, six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun with the lyre, who prophesied in giving thanks and praising Jehovah.',

'28:17': 'And for the flesh hooks and the basins and the pitchers, of pure gold; and for the bowls of gold, by weight for each bowl; and for the bowls of silver, by weight for each bowl;',
'28:18': 'And for the incense [a]altar of refined gold, by weight; and gold for the figure of the chariot, that is, the [b]cherubim, spreading out their wings and covering the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah.',
'28:19': 'All this, said David, has He made clear by a writing from the hand of Jehovah upon me, all the details of the pattern.',
'28:20': 'And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and be bold and do it; do not be afraid or dismayed, for Jehovah God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you until the completion of all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah.',
'28:21': 'And here are the divisions of priests and Levites for all the service of the house of God, and with you in all the work will be every willing man with wisdom for any service; also the leaders and all the people will be wholly at your command.',

'29:3': 'Furthermore, because I set my affection on the house of my God, and since I have a private treasure of gold and silver, I give it for the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for this holy house:',
'29:4': 'Three thousand talents of gold, from the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the houses,',
'29:5': 'Gold for the things of gold and the silver for the things of silver and for all the work by the hands of the craftsmen. And who will offer willingly, [1]consecrating himself today to Jehovah?',
'29:6': 'And the leaders of the fathers&rsquo; houses and the leaders of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the overseers of the king&rsquo;s work offered willingly;',
'29:7': 'And they gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, and ten thousand talents of silver, and eighteen thousand talents of bronze, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.',
'29:8': 'And those with whom gems were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Jehovah through Jehiel the Gershonite.',
'29:9': 'Then the people rejoiced because they offered willingly; for with their whole heart they offered willingly to Jehovah. And David the king also rejoiced with great joy.',
'29:10': 'And David blessed Jehovah in the sight of all the assembly. And David said, You are [a]blessed, O Jehovah, God of Israel our Father, from eternity to eternity.',
'29:11': 'Yours is the [a]greatness and the power and the splendor and the victory and the majesty, indeed all that is in heaven and on earth; Yours, O Jehovah, is the [b]kingdom, and You are exalted as Head over all.',
'29:12': 'Both riches and glory proceed from You, and You rule over all. In Your hand are power and might, and it is in Your hand to make great and to give strength to all.',
'29:13': 'Now therefore, our God, we thank You and praise Your glorious name.',
'29:14': 'But who am I, and who are my people, that we should have strength to offer so willingly in this way? For all things are from You, and from Your hand we have given to You.',
'29:15': 'For we are [a]strangers before You and sojourners, as were all our fathers; our days upon earth are like a [b]shadow, and there is no hope.',
'29:16': 'O Jehovah our God, as for all this abundance that we have prepared for building You a house for Your holy name, it is from Your hand, and all is Yours.',
'29:17': 'I know also, O my God, that You try the [a]heart and take pleasure in uprightness. I, in the uprightness of my heart, have offered willingly all these things; and now I have seen with joy Your people, who are present here, offering willingly to You.',
'29:18': 'O Jehovah, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of Your people&rsquo;s heart and establish their [a]heart toward You.',
'29:19': 'And to Solomon my son give a wholeness of heart to keep Your commandments, Your testimonies, and Your statutes, and to do all and build the palace for which I have prepared these things.',
'29:20': 'Then David said to all the assembly, Bless Jehovah your God.<br>And all the assembly blessed Jehovah, the God of their fathers; and they bowed down and paid homage to Jehovah and the king.',
'29:21': 'And they offered sacrifices to Jehovah and offered up burnt offerings to Jehovah on the next day&mdash;one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, one thousand lambs, with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.',
'29:22': 'And they ate and drank before Jehovah on that day with great joy. And they made Solomon the son of David king a second time and [a]anointed him as ruler for Jehovah, and [b]Zadok as priest.',
'29:23': 'And Solomon sat upon the throne of Jehovah as king in place of David his father and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.',
'29:24': 'And all the leaders and mighty men and also all the sons of King David submitted themselves to Solomon the king.',
'29:25': 'And Jehovah magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him a royal majesty that had never been on any king before him over Israel.',
'29:26': 'Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.',
'29:27': 'And the time which he reigned over Israel was [a]forty years; in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three.',
'29:28': 'And David died at a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor; and Solomon his son reigned in his place.',
'29:29': 'And the acts of David the king, the first and the last, are there written in the chronicles of Samuel the seer and in the chronicles of Nathan the prophet and in the chronicles of Gad the seer,',
'29:30': 'With all his reign and his might and the times that befell him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the lands.',

The central thought of these two books is as follows: First, they give us a full chronology of God&rsquo;s move in man&rsquo;s history by including the genealogy from Adam to Samuel (cf. the chronology in 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel and 1 and 2&nbsp;Kings, which begins with Samuel). This chronology indicates that God&rsquo;s move in man&rsquo;s history to prepare the way for God to carry out His eternal economy in humanity is a matter that concerns not only the history of God&rsquo;s elect but also the history of the entire race of mankind ({Mat1:1|Matt. 1:1}-{Mat1:17|17}; cf. {Luk3:23|Luke 3:23}-{Luk3:38|38}). This is strong evidence that the Christ who was to come as the embodiment of God is not only for the one race chosen by God but for the entire human race created by God. Second, these books present to us some of the important details of God&rsquo;s dealing with the kings of Judah that are not recorded in 1 and 2&nbsp;Samuel and in 1 and 2&nbsp;Kings (see {2Ch11:5^1|note 5<sup>1</sup>} in {2Ch11|2&nbsp;Chron. 11}). Finally, they portray a complete history of God&rsquo;s move in man&rsquo;s history from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Samuel, and from Samuel, who brought in the kingship, to Israel&rsquo;s return from their captivity."]},
