'1:1': 'The [1]elder to [2]Gaius the [a]beloved, whom I [b]love in [3c]truthfulness.',
'1:2': 'Beloved, concerning [1]all things I [2]wish that you may [3]prosper and be in [4]health, even as your [5]soul [3]prospers.',
'1:3': 'For I [1]rejoiced greatly at the brothers&rsquo; coming and [a]testifying to [2]your <I>steadfastness</I> <I>in</I> <I>the</I> truth, even as you [3]walk in [4]truth.',
'1:4': 'I have no greater joy than these things, that I hear that my [a]children are walking in the [b]truth.',
'1:5': '[a]Beloved, you do [b]faithfully in [1]whatever you have wrought for the brothers, and this <I>for</I> [2c]strangers,',
'1:6': 'Who [a]testified to your [1]love before the [2]church; whom you [3]will do well to [b]send forward in a manner [4c]worthy of God;',
'1:7': 'For on behalf of the [1a]Name they went out, taking nothing from the [2]Gentiles.',
'1:8': 'We therefore ought to [1]support such ones that we may become [a]fellow workers in the [2]truth.',
'1:9': 'I wrote something to the [1]church; but [2]Diotrephes, who loves [3]to be [a]first among them, does not [4]receive us.',
'1:10': 'For this reason, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does, [1]babbling against us with [2]evil words; and not being satisfied with these, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and those intending to <I>do</I> <I>so</I> he forbids and [a]casts out of the church.',
'1:11': 'Beloved, do not [a]imitate the [1b]evil, but the good. He who [2]does [c]good is [3]of God; he who [4]does evil has [5d]not seen God.',
'1:12': 'To [1]Demetrius [a]testimony has been borne by [2]all and by the [3]truth itself; and [4]we also testify, and you know that our testimony is [5b]true.',
'1:13': 'I had [a]many things to write to you, but I do not want to write to you with ink and pen;',
'1:14': 'But I [1a]hope to see you shortly, and we will speak [2]face to face.<br class="split">Peace to you. The [b]friends greet you. Greet the friends by [c]name.',

It is contained in the body and is the vessel to contain the spirit. As to the believer, God as the Spirit dwells in his regenerated spirit ({Rom8:9|Rom. 8:9}, {Rom8:16|16}) and spreads from his spirit to saturate his soul that it may be transformed to express Him ({Rom12:2|Rom. 12:2}; {2Co3:18|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:18}). This is the prosperity of the believer&rsquo;s soul. When our soul is occupied and directed by the Spirit of God through our spirit so that it directs and uses our body for God&rsquo;s purposes, it prospers. The apostle wished that the recipient, who was a beloved brother, outstanding in such a prosperity of his soul, might prosper in all things and in bodily health, just as his soul prospered in the divine life."]},
