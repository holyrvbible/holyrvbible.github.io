['Time of Writing', 'Perhaps A.D. 67, after Paul&rsquo;s release from his first Roman imprisonment, while he was in Miletus ({2Ti4:20|2 Tim. 4:20}).'],

verses: {
'1:1': '[1]God, having [a]spoken of old in [2]many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets,',
'1:2': 'Has at the [1]last of these days spoken to us in the [2a]Son, [3]whom He appointed [4b]Heir of all things, [c]through whom also He made the [5d]universe;',
'1:3': 'Who, being the [1]effulgence of His glory and the [a]impress of His substance and [b]upholding and bearing all things by the [2]word of His power, having made [3]purification of sins, [4c]sat down on the right hand of the [5d]Majesty on [6]high;',
'1:4': 'Having become as much better than the angels as to have inherited a [1]more distinguished name than they.',
'1:5': 'For to which of the angels has He ever said, [a]&ldquo;You are My Son; [1]this day have I begotten You&rdquo;? And again, [b]&ldquo;I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me&rdquo;?',
'1:6': 'And when He brings again the [1a]Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, [b]&ldquo;And let all the angels of God worship Him.&rdquo;',
'1:7': 'And of the angels He says, [a]&ldquo;Who makes His angels [1]winds and His ministers a flame of fire&rdquo;;',
'1:8': 'But of the Son, [a]&ldquo;Your [b]throne, [1]O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your [c]kingdom.',
'1:9': 'You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, [1]Your God, has [a]anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your [2b]partners&rdquo;;',
'1:10': 'And, [a]&ldquo;You in the beginning, [1]Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands;',
'1:11': 'They will perish, but You remain perpetually; and they all will become [a]old like a [b]garment,',
'1:12': 'And like a mantle You will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed; but You are the [a]same, and Your years will not fail.&rdquo;',
'1:13': 'But to which of the angels has He ever said, [a]&ldquo;Sit at My right hand [1]until I set Your enemies as a [b]footstool for Your feet&rdquo;?',
'1:14': 'Are they not all [a]ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of [1]those who are to inherit salvation?',
'2:1': '[1]Therefore we ought to give heed more abundantly to the things which have been heard lest perhaps we [2]drift away.',
'2:2': 'For if the word spoken through [a]angels proved firm and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense,',
'2:3': 'How shall we [1a]escape if we have neglected so great a [2b]salvation, which, having had its beginning in being spoken by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who heard,',
'2:4': 'God bearing [a]witness with <I>them</I> both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by [1]distributions of the Holy Spirit according to His will?',
'2:5': 'For <I>it</I> <I>was</I> not to angels <I>that</I> He subjected the coming [1]inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.',
'2:6': 'But one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, [1a]&ldquo;What is man, that You bring him to mind? Or the son of man, that You care for him?',
'2:7': 'You have made Him [1]a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him [a]over the works of Your hands;',
'2:8': 'You have [a]subjected all things under His feet.&rdquo; For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him,',
'2:9': 'But we see Jesus, who was made a little [1]inferior to the angels because of the suffering of [a]death, [b]crowned with [2c]glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of [3d]everything.',
'2:10': 'For it was fitting for [1]Him, [a]for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading [2b]many sons into [3c]glory, to make the [4d]Author of their [e]salvation [5f]perfect through sufferings.',
'2:11': 'For both [1]He who [a]sanctifies and those who are being [b]sanctified are all [2]of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them [c]brothers,',
'2:12': 'Saying, [a]&ldquo;I will [1]declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the [2]church [3]I will sing hymns of praise to You.&rdquo;',
'2:13': 'And again, [a]&ldquo;I will trust in Him.&rdquo; And again, [b]&ldquo;Behold, I and the children whom God has given to Me.&rdquo;',
'2:14': 'Since therefore the children have shared in [a]blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner [b]partook of the same, that through [c]death He might [1d]destroy him who has the might of [e]death, that is, the [f]devil,',
'2:15': 'And might [1]release those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery.',
'2:16': 'For assuredly <I>it</I> <I>is</I> not to angels <I>that</I> He [1]gives help, but He [1]gives help to the seed of Abraham.',
'2:17': 'Hence He should have been [1]made [a]like His brothers in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful [2b]High Priest in the [3]things [c]pertaining to God, to make [4d]propitiation for the sins of the people.',
'2:18': 'For being [a]tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted.',
'3:1': 'Therefore, [1]holy brothers, [2a]partakers of a [3]heavenly [b]calling, consider the [4c]Apostle and [d]High Priest of our confession, Jesus,',
'3:2': 'Who was faithful to Him who constituted Him, as also [a]Moses was in all His [b]house.',
'3:3': 'For He has been counted worthy of more [1a]glory than Moses, by as much as He who [2b]built the house has more [1]honor than [3]the house.',
'3:4': 'For every house is built by someone, but He who built all things is God.',
'3:5': 'And [a]Moses was faithful in all His house as a [1]servant, for a [2]testimony of the things to be spoken later;',
'3:6': 'But Christ <I>was</I> <I>faithful</I> as a Son over His house, whose [1a]house we are if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of [b]hope [c]firm to the end.',
'3:7': '[1]Therefore, even as the Holy [a]Spirit says, [b]&ldquo;Today if you hear His voice,',
'3:8': 'Do not harden your hearts as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness,',
'3:9': 'Where your fathers [a]tried <I>Me</I> by testing <I>Me</I> and saw My works for forty years.',
'3:10': 'Therefore I was [a]displeased with this [b]generation, and I said, They always [1]go astray in their heart, and they have not known My [2]ways;',
'3:11': 'As I swore in My wrath, [1a]They shall not enter into My rest!&rdquo;',
'3:12': 'Beware, brothers, lest perhaps there be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief in [1]falling away from the [a]living God.',
'3:13': 'But [a]exhort one another each day, as long as it is called &ldquo;today,&rdquo; lest any one of you be hardened by the [b]deceitfulness of sin&mdash;',
'3:14': 'For we have become [1a]partners of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance [b]firm to the end&mdash;',
'3:15': 'While it is said, [a]&ldquo;Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the provocation.&rdquo;',
'3:16': 'For who [a]provoked <I>Him</I> when they heard? Indeed was it [b]not all who came out of Egypt by [1]Moses?',
'3:17': 'And with whom was He [a]displeased for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses [b]fell in the wilderness?',
'3:18': 'And to whom did He swear that they should [a]not enter into His rest, except to the [1b]disobedient?',
'3:19': 'And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.',
'4:1': 'Let us fear therefore, lest, a promise being left of entering into His [1]rest, any one of you may [2]seem to have [3]come short <I>of</I> <I>it</I>.',
'4:2': 'For indeed we have had the good news announced to us, even as they also; but the word heard did not profit them, [1]not being mixed together with faith in those who heard.',
'4:3': 'For we who have believed enter into the rest, even as He has said, [a]&ldquo;As I swore in My wrath, They shall not enter into My rest!&rdquo; although the works <I>of</I> <I>creation</I> were completed from the [b]foundation of the world.',
'4:4': 'For He has spoken somewhere concerning the seventh day thus, [a]&ldquo;And God rested on the seventh day from all His works.&rdquo;',
'4:5': 'And in this place again, [a]&ldquo;They shall not enter into My rest!&rdquo;',
'4:6': 'Since therefore it remains that some should enter into it and those who formerly had the good news announced <I>to</I> <I>them</I> did not enter because of [1a]disobedience,',
'4:7': 'He again designates a certain day, today, saying in David after so long a time, even as He has said before, [a]&ldquo;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.&rdquo;',
'4:8': 'For if [1]Joshua had brought them into rest, He would not have spoken concerning [2]another day after these things.',
'4:9': 'So then there remains a [1]Sabbath rest for the people of God.',
'4:10': 'For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as [a]God did from His own.',
'4:11': 'Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone [1]fall [2]after the same example of [3a]disobedience.',
'4:12': 'For the [1a]word of God is [b]living and operative and sharper than any two-edged [c]sword, and piercing even to the dividing of [2d]soul and [e]spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the [3]thoughts and intentions of the heart.',
'4:13': 'And there is no creature that is not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are <I>to</I> <I>give</I> our account.',
'4:14': 'Having therefore a [1]great [2a]High Priest who has [3]passed through the [b]heavens, Jesus, the [c]Son of God, let us hold fast the [4d]confession.',
'4:15': 'For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been [a]tempted in all respects like <I>us</I>, <I>yet</I> [b]without sin.',
'4:16': 'Let us therefore [a]come forward with boldness to the [1]throne of grace that we may receive [2b]mercy and find [c]grace for timely help.',
'5:1': 'For every high priest, being taken from among men, is [a]established on behalf of men in the things [b]pertaining to God that he may [c]offer both [1]gifts and [1]sacrifices for sins.',
'5:2': 'He is [a]able to exercise [1]compassion toward the [b]ignorant and [c]erring since he also is encompassed with [d]weakness;',
'5:3': 'And because of it, he ought, even as [a]for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.',
'5:4': 'And [a]no one takes the honor upon himself, but <I>only</I> as he is called by God, just as [b]Aaron also was.',
'5:5': 'So also Christ did not [1]glorify Himself in becoming a [a]High Priest, but <I>it</I> <I>was</I> He who said to Him, [b]&ldquo;You are My Son; this day have I [2]begotten You&rdquo;;',
'5:6': 'Even as also in another place He says, [1a]&ldquo;You are a Priest forever according to the [2b]order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;',
'5:7': 'This One, in the days of His [a]flesh, having offered up both [b]petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him [1]out of death and having been heard because of <I>His</I> piety,',
'5:8': 'Even though He was a Son, learned [1a]obedience from the things which He [b]suffered.',
'5:9': 'And having been [1a]perfected, He became to all those who obey Him the [2]source of [3]eternal [b]salvation,',
'5:10': 'Being [1]addressed by God as a [a]High Priest according to the [b]order of Melchizedek;',
'5:11': 'Concerning whom we have much to say that is also difficult to interpret since you have become dull of hearing.',
'5:12': 'For when because of the time you ought to be teachers, you have need again for someone to teach you what the [1]rudiments of the [a]beginning of the [2]oracles of God are and have become those who have need of [3b]milk and not of solid [c]food.',
'5:13': 'For everyone who partakes of [1]milk is inexperienced in the [1a]word of righteousness, for he is an [b]infant;',
'5:14': 'But solid food is for the [a]full-grown, who because of practice have their [1]faculties exercised for discriminating between both [2]good and evil.',
'6:1': 'Therefore leaving the [1]word of the [2a]beginning of Christ, let us [3]be brought on to [4b]maturity, not laying again a foundation of [c]repentance from [d]dead works and of [e]faith in God,',
'6:2': 'Of the teaching of [1a]baptisms and of the [b]laying on of hands, of the [c]resurrection of the dead and of eternal [d]judgment.',
'6:3': 'And [1]this we will do if God permits.',
'6:4': 'For it is [1]impossible for those who have once been [a]enlightened and have tasted of the [2]heavenly [b]gift and have become [3c]partakers of the Holy [d]Spirit',
'6:5': 'And have [a]tasted the [b]good [1]word of God and the [2]powers of the age [c]to come,',
'6:6': 'And yet have [1]fallen away, to renew <I>themselves</I> again unto repentance, [2a]crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and [2]putting <I>Him</I> to open shame.',
'6:7': 'For the earth, which drinks the [1]rain which often comes upon it and [2]produces vegetation suitable to those for whose sake also it is cultivated, partakes of blessing from God.',
'6:8': 'But if it brings forth [1a]thorns and thistles, it is [2]disapproved and [3]near a curse, whose end is to be [4b]burned.',
'6:9': 'But we are persuaded of better things concerning you, beloved, and [1]things which belong to [2]salvation, though we speak thus.',
'6:10': 'For God is not unrighteous, so as to forget your [a]work and the love which you have shown toward His [b]name in having [1c]ministered to the saints and in ministering <I>still</I>.',
'6:11': 'But we desire earnestly that each of you show the same diligence unto the full [a]assurance of our [b]hope [c]until the end,',
'6:12': 'That you may not be [1]sluggish, but [a]imitators of those who through [b]faith and long-suffering are [c]inheriting the promises.',
'6:13': 'For God, when He made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, [a]swore by Himself,',
'6:14': 'Saying, [a]&ldquo;Surely blessing, I will bless you; and multiplying, I will multiply you.&rdquo;',
'6:15': 'And thus when <I>Abraham</I> had patiently [a]endured, he obtained the [b]promise.',
'6:16': 'For men swear by the greater, and for all disputes among them an oath is final for confirmation.',
'6:17': 'Therefore God, intending to show more abundantly to the [a]heirs of the promise the [b]unchangeableness of His counsel, interposed with an oath,',
'6:18': 'In order that by [1]two unchangeable things, in which it was impossible for God to [a]lie, we may have strong encouragement, we who have [2]fled for [3]refuge to lay hold of the [b]hope set before <I>us</I>,',
'6:19': 'Which we have as an [1]anchor of the soul, both secure and firm and which [2]enters within the veil,',
'6:20': 'Where the [1a]Forerunner, Jesus, has entered for us, having become forever a High Priest according to the [b]order of Melchizedek.',
'7:1': '[1]For this [2a]Melchizedek, [2]king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the [b]slaughter of the kings and blessed him,',
'7:2': 'To whom also Abraham apportioned a [a]tenth part of all; first being interpreted [1b]king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is [1c]king of peace;',
'7:3': 'Being [1]without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither [a]beginning of days nor [b]end of life, but likened to the Son of God, abides a priest [c]perpetually.',
'7:4': 'And consider how [1a]great this one was, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the choice spoils.',
'7:5': 'And they of the sons of Levi, who received the priestly service, have a commandment to take [a]tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham.',
'7:6': 'But he whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has [1a]blessed him who has the promises.',
'7:7': 'But without any dispute the [1]lesser is blessed by the [2]greater.',
'7:8': 'And here men, who die, receive tithes; but there, one [a]of whom it is testified that he [b]lives.',
'7:9': 'And, so to speak, through Abraham, [1]Levi also, he who receives tithes, has been made to pay tithes,',
'7:10': 'For he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.',
'7:11': 'If indeed then perfection were through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), what need was there still that a different [1]Priest should arise according to the order of [a]Melchizedek and that He should not be said <I>to</I> <I>be</I> according to the order of Aaron?',
'7:12': 'For since the [a]priesthood is [1]transferred, of necessity there comes into being a [2b]transfer of law also.',
'7:13': 'For He of whom these things are said [1]belongs to a different tribe, from which [a]no one has attended to the altar.',
'7:14': 'For it is evident that our Lord has [1]risen out of [2a]Judah, concerning which tribe Moses spoke nothing about priests.',
'7:15': 'And it is still more abundantly evident since <I>it</I> <I>is</I> according to the [a]likeness of Melchizedek <I>that</I> a different Priest arises,',
'7:16': 'Who has been appointed not according to the law of a [a]fleshy commandment but according to the [b]power of an [1]indestructible [c]life.',
'7:17': 'For it is testified, &ldquo;You are a Priest forever according to the [a]order of Melchizedek.&rdquo;',
'7:18': 'For there is, on the one hand, the [1a]setting aside of the preceding commandment because of its [b]weakness and unprofitableness',
'7:19': '(For the [a]law [1b]perfected nothing), and, on the other hand, the bringing in [2]thereupon of a [3]better [c]hope, through which we [d]draw near to God.',
'7:20': 'And inasmuch as <I>He</I> <I>was</I> not <I>made</I> <I>a</I> <I>Priest</I> without the taking of an oath',
'7:21': '(For they are appointed priests without the taking of an oath, but He, with the taking of an oath by Him who said to Him, [a]&ldquo;The Lord has sworn and will not regret <I>it</I>, You are a Priest forever&rdquo;),',
'7:22': 'By so much Jesus has also become the [1]surety of a [a]better [b]covenant.',
'7:23': 'And they are appointed priests many in number because death prevents <I>them</I> from continuing;',
'7:24': 'But He, because He [a]abides forever, has His priesthood unalterable.',
'7:25': 'Hence also He is [a]able to save [1]to the uttermost those who [b]come forward to God through Him, since He [c]lives always to [2d]intercede for them.',
'7:26': 'For such a [a]High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, [b]guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners and having become [1]higher than the [c]heavens,',
'7:27': 'Who does not have daily need, as the high priests <I>do</I>, to [a]offer up sacrifices first for his [b]own sins and then for those of the people; for this He did [c]once for all when He [d]offered up Himself.',
'7:28': 'For the law establishes men as high priests who have [a]weakness, but the word of the oath, which <I>was</I> after the law, <I>establishes</I> the [b]Son, [1c]perfected forever.',
'8:1': 'Now in the things which are being said the chief point <I>is</I> <I>this</I>: We have such a [a]High Priest, who sat down on the [b]right hand of the [c]throne of the [d]Majesty in the [1]heavens,',
'8:2': 'A [1a]Minister of the [2b]holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.',
'8:3': 'For every high priest is established for the [a]offering of both [1]gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary that this One also have something which He may [b]offer.',
'8:4': 'Now then if He were on earth, He would not be a Priest at all, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,',
'8:5': 'Who serve the [1a]example and [b]shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, [c]&ldquo;See,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain.&rdquo;',
'8:6': 'But now He has obtained a more excellent [1]ministry inasmuch as He is also the [2a]Mediator of a [3b]better [c]covenant, which has been [4]enacted upon [5]better [d]promises.',
'8:7': 'For if that [1a]first <I>covenant</I> had been faultless, no [2]place would have been [b]sought for a [1]second.',
'8:8': 'For finding fault with them He says, [a]&ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a [b]new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah,',
'8:9': 'Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord.',
'8:10': 'For [a]this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My [1]laws into their [2]mind, and on their hearts I will [3]inscribe them; and [4]I will be God to them, and [5]they will be a people to Me.',
'8:11': 'And they shall by no means each [a]teach his fellow citizen and each his brother, saying, [1]Know the Lord; for all will [1]know Me from the little one to the great one among them.',
'8:12': 'For [a]I will be [1]propitious to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins I shall by no means remember anymore.&rdquo;',
'8:13': 'In saying, A [a]new <I>covenant</I>, He has made the [1]first old. But that which is becoming old and growing decrepit is near to [b]disappearing.',
'9:1': 'Now then the [a]first <I>covenant</I> also had [b]ordinances of service, and its [1c]sanctuary was of [d]this world.',
'9:2': 'For a [a]tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which were the [b]lampstand and the [c]table and the [d]loaves that were set forth, which is called the [e]Holy Place;',
'9:3': 'And after the second [a]veil, a [b]tabernacle, which is called the [c]Holy of Holies,',
'9:4': '[1]Having a [a]golden [2]altar and the [b]Ark of the Covenant covered about everywhere with gold, in which were the golden [3c]pot that had the manna and Aaron&rsquo;s [d]rod that budded and the [e]tablets of the covenant,',
'9:5': 'And above it [a]cherubim of glory overshadowing the [1b]expiation cover, concerning which it is not now <I>the</I> <I>time</I> to speak in detail.',
'9:6': 'Now these things having been thus prepared, [a]into the [b]first tabernacle the priests enter [c]continually, accomplishing their worship;',
'9:7': 'But into the [a]second, only the [b]high priest <I>enters</I>, [c]once a year <I>and</I> not without [d]blood, which he offers for [e]himself and for the [1]sins of ignorance of the [f]people,',
'9:8': 'The [a]Holy Spirit <I>thus</I> making this clear, that the [1b]way of the [c]<I>Holy</I> <I>of</I> Holies has not yet been manifested while the [d]first tabernacle still has <I>its</I> standing,',
'9:9': 'Which is a [1a]figure for the present time. According to <I>this</I> <I>tabernacle</I> both [2b]gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are [c]unable to perfect, according to [d]conscience, him who worships,',
'9:10': '<I>Consisting</I> only of [a]foods and drinks and various [1b]washings, being ordinances of the flesh, imposed until the time of [2]setting things right.',
'9:11': 'But Christ, having come as a [a]High Priest of [1]the [b]good things that have come into being, through the greater and more perfect [c]tabernacle not [d]made by hands, that is, not of [e]this creation,',
'9:12': 'And not through the [a]blood of goats and calves but through His [b]own blood, [c]entered [d]once for all into the [e]<I>Holy</I> <I>of</I> Holies, [1]obtaining an [f]eternal [2]redemption.',
'9:13': 'For if the [a]blood of goats and bulls and the [b]ashes of a heifer [c]sprinkling those who are [1]defiled sanctify to the purity of the flesh,',
'9:14': 'How much more will the [1a]blood of Christ, who through the [2]eternal Spirit [b]offered Himself [c]without blemish to God, purify our [3d]conscience from [4e]dead works to [f]serve the [5g]living God?',
'9:15': 'And because of this He is the [a]Mediator of a [b]new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the [1]transgressions under the [c]first covenant, those who have been [d]called might receive the [2]promise of the [3]eternal [e]inheritance.',
'9:16': 'For where there is a [1]testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established.',
'9:17': 'For a [1]testament is confirmed [2]in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living.',
'9:18': 'Hence neither was the [a]first <I>covenant</I> [1]initiated without [b]blood;',
'9:19': 'For when every commandment according to the law had been spoken by Moses to all the people, he [a]took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and [b]scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll <I>of</I> <I>the</I> <I>covenant</I> itself and all the people,',
'9:20': 'Saying, &ldquo;This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded to you.&rdquo;',
'9:21': 'And both the [a]tabernacle and all the vessels of the service he sprinkled in like manner with the blood.',

'9:23': 'It was necessary therefore for the [a]examples of the things in the heavens to be purified by these, but the [1]heavenly things themselves, by [2b]better sacrifices than these.',

'9:26': 'Since then He would have had to suffer often [a]since the foundation of the world. But now [b]once at the [1c]consummation of the ages He has been [d]manifested for the [e]putting away of sin through the [f]sacrifice of Himself.',
'9:27': 'And inasmuch as it is [1]reserved for men to [a]die [2]once, and after this <I>comes</I> [b]judgment,',
'9:28': 'So Christ also, having been offered [a]once to [b]bear the sins of many, will [c]appear a second time to those who [d]eagerly await Him, [1]apart from sin, unto [2e]salvation.',

'10:2': 'Otherwise would they not have [a]ceased to be offered, because those worshipping, having once been purified, would have no longer had the [b]consciousness of sins?',
'10:3': 'But in those <I>sacrifices</I> there is a bringing to mind of sins [a]year by year;',
'10:4': 'For it is [a]impossible for the [b]blood of bulls and goats to [c]take away sins.',

'10:13': 'Henceforth waiting until His [a]enemies are made the footstool for His feet.',
'10:14': 'For by [a]one offering He has [1b]perfected forever those who are being [c]sanctified.',
'10:15': 'And the [a]Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after having said,',

Now He is the revealed God.","The emphasis of this book is that God, not man, has spoken. Therefore, it does not identify its writer, nor in any of its quotations from the Old Testament does it mention the speaker&rsquo;s name. According to the concept of this book, the entire Scripture is the speaking of God. Hence, in referring to the Old Testament, this book always says that it is the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s speaking ({Heb3:7|3:7}; {Heb9:8|9:8}; {Heb10:15|10:15}-{Heb10:17|17})."]},

The first Hebrew was Abraham ({Gen14:13|Gen. 14:13}), the father of all those who contact God by faith ({Rom4:11|Rom. 4:11}-{Rom4:12|12}). Therefore, God is called &ldquo;the God of the Hebrews&rdquo; ({Exo9:1|Exo. 9:1}, {Exo9:13|13}). The root of the word Hebrew means to pass over. It can mean specifically to pass over a river, that is, to pass over from this side of the river to the other side, to pass over from one side to another. Therefore, a Hebrew is a river crosser. Abraham was such a one. From Chaldea, the land of idolatry, which was on the other side of the great river Euphrates, he crossed over to Canaan, the land of the worship of God, which was on this side of the Euphrates ({Jos24:2|Josh. 24:2}-{Jos24:3|3}). The intention of God&rsquo;s speaking in this book was that the Jews who believed in the Lord but still lingered in Judaism would leave the law and cross over to grace ({Heb4:16|4:16}; {Heb7:18|7:18}-{Heb7:19|19}; {Heb12:28|12:28}; {Heb13:9|13:9}), that they would leave the old covenant and cross over to the new covenant ({Heb8:6|8:6}-{Heb8:7|7}, {Heb8:13|13}), and that they would leave the ritualistic service of the Old Testament and cross over to the spiritual reality of the New Testament ({Heb8:5|8:5}; {Heb9:9|9:9}-{Heb9:14|14}); that is, that they would leave Judaism and cross over to the church ({Heb13:13|13:13}; {Heb10:25|10:25}), that they would leave the earthly things and cross over to the heavenly things ({Heb12:18|12:18}-{Heb12:24|24}), that they would leave the outer court, where the altar is, and cross over to the Holiest of all, where God is ({Heb13:9|13:9}-{Heb13:10|10}; {Heb10:19|10:19}-{Heb10:20|20}), that they would leave the soul and cross over to the spirit ({Heb4:12|4:12}), and that they would leave the beginning of truth and life and cross over to the maturity of life in the truth ({Heb5:11|5:11}&mdash;{Heb6:1|6:1}). Not only the Jews who believed in the Lord but all who contact God by faith should be such river crossers. This is the purpose of God&rsquo;s speaking in this book."]},

But the Sabbath rest mentioned here and typified by the rest of the good land of Canaan covers only the first two stages of Christ&rsquo;s being our rest; it does not include the third stage. The rest in the first two stages is a prize to His diligent seekers, who not only are redeemed but also have enjoyed Him in a full way, thus becoming the overcomers; whereas the rest in the third stage is not a prize but the full portion allotted to all the redeemed ones. Therefore, in the first two stages, and especially in the second, Christ as our rest is the Sabbath rest mentioned here, the rest that remains for us to seek after and enter into diligently. It is in the second stage of His being our rest that Christ will take possession of the whole earth as His inheritance ({Psa2:8|Psa. 2:8}; {Heb2:5|Heb. 2:5}-{Heb2:6|6}), making it His kingdom for a thousand years ({Rev11:15|Rev. 11:15}).

Moreover, they will inherit the earth ({Mat5:5|Matt. 5:5}; {Psa37:11|Psa. 37:11}), some having authority over ten cities, some over five ({Luk19:17|Luke 19:17}, {Luk19:19|19}), and will partake of the joy of their Lord ({Mat25:21|Matt. 25:21}, {Mat25:23|23}). That will be the kingdom rest, which is typified by the rest of entering into the good land of Canaan. The rest of the good land was the goal of all the children of Israel, who had been redeemed and delivered from Egypt; likewise, the rest of the coming kingdom is the goal of the New Testament believers, who have been redeemed and saved from the world. We are now all on the way toward this goal.","God&rsquo;s full salvation, which He intended for the children of Israel, included redemption through the passover lamb, the exodus from Egypt, feeding on the heavenly manna, having their thirst quenched by the living water from the cleft rock, and partaking of the good land of Canaan. All the children of Israel shared in the passover lamb, the heavenly manna, and the living water, but only Joshua and Caleb, out of those who shared the exodus from Egypt, entered into the good land and partook of it; all the rest fell in the wilderness ({Num14:30|Num. 14:30}; {1Co10:1|1&nbsp;Cor. 10:1}-{1Co10:11|11}). Though all were redeemed, only the two overcomers, Joshua and Caleb, received the prize of the good land.","The passover lamb, the heavenly manna, the living water, and the good land of Canaan are all types of different aspects of Christ. According to what is depicted by the experiences of the children of Israel, not all believers who have been redeemed through Christ will partake of Christ as a prize, as their rest, their satisfaction, in both the church age and the coming kingdom; only those who, after being redeemed, seek Christ diligently will partake of Him in such a way. This is why the apostle Paul, though fully redeemed, was still pursuing toward the goal that he might gain Christ as the prize ({Phi3:10|Phil. 3:10}-{Phi3:14|14}). In {Phi3|Phil. 3} Paul told us that he had been in Judaism but that for Christ&rsquo;s sake he had given it up ({Phi3:4|Phil. 3:4}-{Phi3:9|9}).

Here, in this verse, are the joints and marrow&mdash;which are parts of the body&mdash;and the soul and spirit.","The foregoing verses describe the children of Israel as falling away from entering into the rest of the good land. With them there were three places: (1) Egypt, from which they were delivered; (2) the wilderness, in which they wandered; and (3) Canaan, into which they entered. Their history in these three places signifies the three stages of their participation in God&rsquo;s full salvation. This is a type of us, the New Testament believers, in our participation in the full salvation of God. In the first stage we receive Christ and are redeemed and delivered from the world. In the second stage we become wanderers in following the Lord; our wandering always takes place in our soul. In the third stage we partake of and enjoy Christ in a full way; this is experienced in our spirit. When we pursue the pleasures of material and sinful things, we are in the world, typified by Egypt. When we wander in our soul, we are in the wilderness. When we enjoy Christ in our spirit, we are in Canaan. When the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness, they were always murmuring, reasoning, and chiding. This surely took place in their soul, not in their spirit. But Caleb and Joshua believed in the word of God, obeyed the Lord, and pressed toward the goal. This surely took place not in their soul but in their spirit. At that time the receivers of this book, the Hebrew believers, were wondering what they should do with their old Hebrew religion. This wondering in their mind was a wandering in their soul, not an experience of Christ in their spirit. So the writer of this book said that the word of God, i.e., what was quoted from the Old Testament, could pierce into their wondering like a sharp two-edged sword and divide their soul from their spirit. As the marrow is concealed deep in the joints, so the spirit is deep in the soul. The dividing of the marrow from the joints requires mainly the breaking of the joints. In the same principle, the dividing of the spirit from the soul requires the breaking of the soul. The Hebrew believers&rsquo; soul, with its wondering mind, its doubting concerning God&rsquo;s way of salvation, and its considering of its own interests, had to be broken by the living, operative, and piercing word of God that their spirit might be divided from their soul.","Our soul is our very self ({Mat16:25|Matt. 16:25}; cf. {Luk9:25|Luke 9:25}). In following the Lord we must deny our soul, our very self ({Mat16:24|Matt. 16:24}; {Luk9:23|Luke 9:23}). Our spirit is the deepest part of our being, a spiritual organ with which we contact God ({Joh4:24|John 4:24}; {Rom1:9|Rom. 1:9}). It is in our spirit that we are regenerated ({Joh3:6|John 3:6}). It is in our spirit that the Holy Spirit dwells and works ({Rom8:16|Rom. 8:16}). It is in our spirit that we enjoy Christ and His grace ({2Ti4:22|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:22}; {Gal6:18|Gal. 6:18}). Hence, the writer of this book advised the Hebrew believers not to stagger in the wandering of their soul, which soul they had to deny, but to press on into their spirit to partake of and enjoy the heavenly Christ that they might participate in the kingdom rest of His reign in the millennium. If they staggered in the wandering of their soul, they would miss God&rsquo;s goal and suffer the loss of the full enjoyment of Christ and the kingdom rest."]},

Our heart is not separate from our soul and spirit but is a composition of all the parts of our soul, plus the conscience, a part of our spirit. Hence, in our heart is the mind, with the thoughts, and the will, with the intentions. The thoughts affect the intentions, and the intentions carry out the thoughts. The living word of God is able to discern the thoughts in our mind and the intentions in our will.

The oracle denotes the Holy of Holies, in which was the Ark of the Testimony with the expiation cover, where God spoke to His people. Thus, the Old Testament indicated beforehand that the incense altar belonged to the Holy of Holies. (Though the incense altar was in the Holy Place, its function was for the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies. On the Day of Expiation, both the incense altar and the expiation cover of the Ark of the Testimony were sprinkled with the same blood for expiation&mdash;{Exo30:10|Exo. 30:10}; {Lev16:15|Lev. 16:15}-{Lev16:16|16}.) Hence, in {Exo26:35|Exo. 26:35} only the showbread table and the lampstand are mentioned as being in the Holy Place; the incense altar is not mentioned.","(3) The incense altar is related to prayer ({Luk1:10|Luke 1:10}-{Luk1:11|11}), and in this book we are shown that to pray is to enter the Holy of Holies ({Heb10:19|10:19}) and to come to the throne of grace, which is signified by the expiation cover over the Ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies. Our prayer often begins with our mind, which is a part of our soul, signified by the Holy Place. But our prayer always ushers us into our spirit, signified by the Holy of Holies.","(4) On account of all the above points, the writer of this book had to consider the incense altar as belonging to the Holy of Holies. {Heb9:4|Verse 4} does not say that a golden altar was in the Holy of Holies, as the lampstand and the table were in the Holy Place ({Heb9:2|v. 2}). It says that the Holy of Holies had a golden altar, because the altar belonged to the Holy of Holies. This concept fits the entire emphasis of the book of Hebrews, i.e., that we should press on from the soul (signified by the Holy Place) to the spirit (signified by the Holy of Holies).","The incense altar belongs to the oracle&mdash;the speaking place of God, i.e., the Holy of Holies. The incense altar typifies Christ in His resurrection as the sweet and fragrant incense, in which God extends to us His well-pleased acceptance. We pray with such a Christ in order to contact God that God may be pleased to speak to us. We speak to God in our prayer with Christ as the sweet incense, and God speaks to us in the sweet savor of this incense. This is the dialogue in the sweet fellowship between us and God through Christ as the sweet incense."]},

In the Holy Place were the showbread table and the lampstand, with the incense altar located close to the Holy of Holies, in front of the Ark of the Testimony. The showbread table signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply, and the lampstand, our experience of Christ as the shining light. These experiences are rather inward, in the intellect and consciousness of our being. The incense altar signifies our experience of Christ as the sweet incense ascending to God. This experience is deeper and more inward, leading to the deepest and most inward experiences, in the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies was the Ark of the Testimony, in which were the golden pot containing the hidden manna; Aaron&rsquo;s budding rod; and the tablets of the covenant. The hidden manna in the golden pot signifies our experience of Christ as our life supply in the deepest way, an experience much deeper than that signified by the showbread table in the Holy Place. The budding rod signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry. This is deeper than the experience of Christ as the incense for our acceptance by God. The tablets of the covenant, which are the tablets of the Ten Commandments, signify our experience of Christ as the enlightening inner law, which regulates us according to God&rsquo;s divine nature.

Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens, in the person of the Son of God ({Heb1:5|1:5}) and the Son of Man ({Heb2:6|2:6}), in the person of God ({Heb1:8|1:8}) and man ({Heb2:6|2:6}), as the appointed Heir of all things ({Heb1:2|1:2}), the anointed One of God ({Heb1:9|1:9}), the Author of our salvation ({Heb2:10|2:10}), the Sanctifier ({Heb2:11|2:11}), the constant Succor ({Heb2:16|2:16}), the instant Helper ({Heb4:16|4:16}), the Apostle from God ({Heb3:1|3:1}), the High Priest ({Heb2:17|2:17}; {Heb4:14|4:14}; {Heb7:26|7:26}), the Minister of the true tabernacle ({Heb8:2|8:2}) with a more excellent ministry ({Heb8:6|8:6}), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant ({Heb7:22|7:22}; {Heb8:6|8:6}; {Heb12:24|12:24}), the Executor of the new testament ({Heb9:16|9:16}-{Heb9:17|17}), the Forerunner ({Heb6:20|6:20}), the Author and Perfecter of faith ({Heb12:2|v. 2}), and the great Shepherd of the sheep ({Heb13:20|13:20}). If we look to Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He will minister heaven, life, and strength to us, transfusing and infusing us with all that He is, that we may be able to run the heavenly race and live the heavenly life on earth. In this way He will carry us through all the lifelong pathway and lead and bring us into glory ({Heb2:10|2:10})."]},

In that sense we are the firstborn sons of God. Hence, the church, composed of us, is called the church of the firstborn ({Heb12:23|v. 23}). As the firstborn sons of God, we have the birthright. This includes the inheritance of the earth ({Heb2:5|2:5}-{Heb2:6|6}), the priesthood ({Rev20:6|Rev. 20:6}), and the kingship ({Rev20:4|Rev. 20:4}), which will be the main blessings in the coming kingdom and which the profane, world-loving-and-seeking Christians will lose at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. Eventually, this birthright will be a reward given to the overcoming Christians in the millennial kingdom. Any worldly enjoyment, even one meal, could cause us to forfeit this birthright of ours. After such a serious warning, if the Hebrew believers had still preferred to indulge in &ldquo;one meal&rdquo; of their old religion, they would have missed the full enjoyment of Christ and would have lost the kingdom rest with all its blessings.","Esau was not the only one who lost his birthright ({Gen25:29|Gen. 25:29}-{Gen25:34|34}); Reuben was another who lost the blessing of the birthright ({Gen49:3|Gen. 49:3}-{Gen49:4|4}; {1Ch5:1|1&nbsp;Chron. 5:1}). Esau lost it because of his lust in eating. Reuben lost it because of the defilement of his lust. Both cases should be warnings to us.

The proper enjoyment of this foretaste will usher us into the full taste of the kingdom blessings. If we do not enjoy Christ today as our good land, as defined in {Heb4:9^1|note 9<sup>1</sup>} of {Heb4|ch. 4}, how can we enter into His rest in the kingdom and inherit the earth with Him? If we do not exercise our priesthood today to contact Him and prayerfully minister to Him, how can we fulfill our priestly duty in the kingdom? If we do not exercise our spirit with the God-given authority to rule our self, our flesh, our entire being, and the enemy with all his power of darkness today, how can we be Christ&rsquo;s co-kings and rule the nations with Him in His kingdom ({Rev2:26|Rev. 2:26}-{Rev2:27|27})?

These things signify the side of grace, where both the firstborn and the spirits of righteous men are saved by grace. The people under the old covenant came to the side of the law, whereas we Christians, who are under the new covenant, come to the side of grace. Hence, we are not under the law but under grace ({Rom6:14|Rom. 6:14}). This portion of the word (vv. {Heb12:18|18}-{Heb12:24|24}), like {Gal4:21|Gal. 4:21}-{Gal4:31|31}, shows us that we are not under the bondage of the law but under the freedom of grace to be the heirs of the inheritance. This is our birthright! We should not give this up by falling away from grace ({Heb12:15|v. 15}), but should have grace ({Heb12:28|v. 28}). The things on the side of grace are heavenly, but not all are in heaven yet. A great number of the firstborn of the church are still on earth, while the spirits of righteous men, who are the Old Testament saints, are in Paradise, where Abraham is ({Luk16:22|Luke 16:22}-{Luk16:23|23}, {Luk16:25|25}-{Luk16:26|26}) and where the Lord Jesus and the saved robber went after they died on the cross ({Luk23:43|Luke 23:43}).","None of the six items listed on the side of the law is pleasant. First, there is a mountain set on fire. Who would approach such a place? Then there are the darkness, the gloom, and the stormy whirlwind. Last, there are the terrifying sound of a trumpet and the solemn, warning voice of words. All these present a fearsome sight. On the side of grace, however, everything is pleasant. The eight items here can be considered four pairs. The elevated Mount Zion and the beautiful heavenly Jerusalem are the first pair, denoting God&rsquo;s habitation and the center of His universal administration. What a lovely place! The celebrating, jubilant angels, so closely related to the heirs of salvation to whom they minister ({Heb1:14|1:14}), and the blessed firstborn of the church form the second pair in the scene. What a joyful demonstration of an angelic gathering! They celebrate the participation by the human heirs of salvation, the church of the firstborn, in the blessings of the new covenant. God, the Judge of all, and the spirits of righteous men, the Old Testament saints (their bodies, not resurrected, were not worthy to be listed in this portion) are linked as the third pair, showing that God, being righteous, justifies the righteous saints of old because of their faith. The dear Lord Jesus, the Mediator of the new covenant, which is a better covenant, and His precious sprinkled blood, which speaks something better, compose the last pair, indicating that a better covenant was enacted with Jesus&rsquo; better blood, that Jesus died and bequeathed this new covenant as a new testament to His believers, and that He is now the Mediator, the Executor, of this new testament, bringing about the full realization of all the blessed facts contained within it. What a pleasant scene! What a contrast to the scene on the side of the law, where no God, no Savior, and even no angels are mentioned! It is no wonder that not one saved person is seen there. In the scene of grace there is the justifying God, the Savior, who is the Mediator of His new testament, with His speaking blood, the ministering angels with the assembly (the church) of the saved ones, and the spirits of the justified saints. On the side of the law the scene ends with the terrifying sound of a trumpet and the warning words. On the side of grace the scene ends with a sympathizing Mediator and a vindicating speaking. After seeing such a contrast, who would be so foolish as to leave the side of grace and turn to the side of the law? All eight items on the side of grace are not only heavenly and spiritual but also eternal. Hence, even when heaven is shaken ({Heb12:26|v. 26}), these eight items that are eternal will still remain ({Heb12:27|v. 27})."]},

All the negative points of these warnings are related to the suffering of the loss of the reward in the coming kingdom, whereas all the positive points are related to the reward and enjoyment of the kingdom. All seven epistles in {Rev2|Rev. 2} and {Rev3|3} conclude with this same concept&mdash;the reward of the kingdom or the loss of it. Only in light of this concept can we rightly understand and properly apply the word in {Mat5:20|Matt. 5:20}; {Mat7:21|7:21}-{Mat7:23|23}; {Mat16:24|16:24}-{Mat16:27|27}; {Mat19:23|19:23}-{Mat19:30|30}; {Mat24:46|24:46}-{Mat24:51|51}; {Mat25:11|25:11}-{Mat25:13|13}, {Mat25:21|21}, {Mat25:23|23}, {Mat25:26|26}-{Mat25:30|30}; {Luk12:42|Luke 12:42}-{Luk12:48|48}; {Luk19:17|19:17}, {Luk19:19|19}, {Luk19:22|22}-{Luk19:27|27}; {Rom14:10|Rom. 14:10}, {Rom14:12|12}; {1Co3:8|1&nbsp;Cor. 3:8}, {1Co3:13|13}-{1Co3:15|15}; {1Co4:5|4:5}; {1Co9:24|9:24}-{1Co9:27|27}; {2Co5:10|2&nbsp;Cor. 5:10}; {2Ti4:7|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:7}-{2Ti4:8|8}; {Heb2:3|Heb. 2:3}; {Heb4:1|4:1}, {Heb4:9|9}, {Heb4:11|11}; {Heb6:4|6:4}-{Heb6:8|8}; {Heb10:26|10:26}-{Heb10:31|31}, {Heb10:35|35}-{Heb10:39|39}; {Heb12:16|12:16}-{Heb12:17|17}, {Heb12:28|28}-{Heb12:29|29}; and {Rev2:7|Rev. 2:7}, {Rev2:10|10}-{Rev2:11|11}, {Rev2:17|17}, {Rev2:26|26}-{Rev2:27|27}; {Rev3:4|3:4}-{Rev3:5|5}, {Rev3:11|11}-{Rev3:12|12}, {Rev3:20|20}; {Rev22:12|22:12}. If we do not have this concept, the interpretation of these verses falls into either the extreme objectiveness of the Calvinist school or the extreme subjectiveness of the Arminian school. Neither of these schools recognizes the reward of the kingdom; even more, they do not see the suffering of the loss of the kingdom reward. Hence, both consider all the negative points in these verses as referring to perdition. The Calvinist school, believing in eternal salvation (i.e., that once a person is saved, he will never perish), regards all these negative points as applying to the perdition of false believers; while the Arminian school, believing that a saved person will perish if he falls, regards these points as applying to the perdition of believers who have fallen. But the complete revelation of the Bible shows that these negative points refer to the suffering of the loss of the kingdom reward. God&rsquo;s salvation is eternal; once we obtain it, we will never lose it ({Joh10:28|John 10:28}-{Joh10:29|29}). But we may suffer the loss of the kingdom reward, even though we still will be saved ({1Co3:8|1&nbsp;Cor. 3:8}, {1Co3:14|14}-{1Co3:15|15}). The warnings in Hebrews do not refer to the loss of eternal salvation but to the loss of the kingdom reward. The Hebrew believers had received the kingdom, but they risked losing the reward in the manifestation of the kingdom if they shrank back from the grace of God, from God&rsquo;s new covenant way. This was the writer&rsquo;s main concern in warning the staggering Hebrew believers."]},

To have grace ({Heb12:28|12:28}) we need to come forward to the throne of grace that we may find grace for timely help ({Heb4:16|4:16}). It is when we touch the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies through the exercise of our spirit that we enjoy the Spirit of grace ({Heb10:29|10:29}) and that our heart is confirmed by grace ({Heb13:9|v. 9}). By such an enjoyment of grace we run the race set before us ({Heb12:1|12:1}) that we may reach the goal of God&rsquo;s economy."]},
