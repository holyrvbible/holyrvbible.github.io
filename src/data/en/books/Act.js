verses: {
'1:1': 'The [1]former account I have made, O [2]Theophilus, concerning all the [3]things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,',
'1:2': 'Until the day on which He was [a]taken up, after He had given [b]commandment through the Holy [1]Spirit to the [c]apostles whom He chose;',
'1:3': 'To whom also He [1]presented Himself alive after His suffering by many irrefutable proofs, [2a]appearing to them through <I>a</I> <I>period</I> <I>of</I> [3]forty days and speaking the things concerning the [4]kingdom of God.',
'1:4': 'And as He [1]met together with <I>them</I>, He charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the [2a]promise of the Father, which, <I>He</I> [b]<I>said</I>, You heard from Me;',
'1:5': 'For John [a]baptized with [1]water, but you shall be [2]baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.',
'1:6': 'So the ones who came together asked Him, saying, Lord, are You at this [a]time [b]restoring the [1]kingdom to Israel?',
'1:7': 'But He said to them, It is not for you to know [a]times or seasons which the Father has set by His own authority.',
'1:8': 'But you shall [1]receive [a]power when the Holy [b]Spirit comes [2]upon you, and you shall be My [3c]witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all [d]Judea and [e]Samaria and unto the [f]uttermost part of the earth.',
'1:9': 'And when He had said these things, while they were looking on, He was lifted up, and a cloud [a]took Him away from their sight.',
'1:10': 'And while they were looking intently into heaven as He went, behold, [a]two men in [b]white clothing stood beside them,',
'1:11': 'Who also said, [1]Men of [a]Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into [2]heaven, will [3b]come in the [4]same way as you [5]beheld Him going into heaven.',
'1:12': 'Then they returned to [1a]Jerusalem from the mount called [b]Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a [2]Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey away.',
'1:13': 'And when they entered, they went up to the [a]upper room where they were residing, [b]Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James <I>the</I> <I>son</I> of Alphaeus and Simon the [1]Zealot and Judas <I>the</I> [2]<I>brother</I> of James.',
'1:14': 'These all [1a]continued steadfastly [2]with [b]one accord in [3]prayer, together with the [c]women and [4]Mary the [d]mother of Jesus, and with His brothers.',
'1:15': 'And in those days [a]Peter stood up in the midst of the [b]brothers and [1]said (there was a group of persons <I>gathered</I> together, about a hundred and twenty),',
'1:16': '[1]Men, brothers, the [a]Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before through the mouth of David concerning [b]Judas, who became a guide to those who seized Jesus;',
'1:17': 'For he was [a]numbered among us and was allotted his portion of [1]this [b]ministry.',
'1:18': '(Now this man acquired a piece of [a]land with the [1b]wages of unrighteousness; and falling headlong, he burst in the middle, and all his inward parts gushed out.',
'1:19': 'And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, so that that piece of land was called in their own dialect, [1]Akeldamach, that is, Field of [2]Blood.)',
'1:20': 'For it is written in the book of Psalms, [a]&ldquo;Let his habitation become desolate, and let no one dwell in it&rdquo;; and, [b]&ldquo;His overseership let another take.&rdquo;',
'1:21': 'It is necessary therefore that of the men who accompanied us all the time in which the Lord Jesus [a]went in and went out [1]among us,',
'1:22': 'Beginning from the baptism of [a]John until the day on which He was [b]taken up from us, one of these should become a [c]witness of His [1d]resurrection with us.',
'1:23': 'And they proposed two, Joseph, called [a]Barsabbas, who was surnamed [b]Justus, and Matthias.',
'1:24': 'And they [a]prayed and said, You Lord, Knower of the [b]hearts of all, show <I>us</I> clearly the one whom You have chosen of these two',
'1:25': 'To take the place of this ministry and [a]apostleship, from which Judas turned aside to [b]go to his own place.',
'1:26': 'And they cast [1]lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was counted with the eleven apostles.',
'2:1': 'And as the day of [1a]Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place.',
'2:2': 'And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven, as of a rushing violent [1a]wind, and it [2b]filled the whole house where they were sitting.',
'2:3': 'And there appeared to them [1]tongues as of [2]fire, which were distributed; and it [3]sat on each one of them;',
'2:4': 'And they were [1]all [2]filled with the Holy Spirit and began to [a]speak in different [3b]tongues, even as the [c]Spirit gave to them to [4]speak forth.',
'2:5': 'Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem [1]Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven.',
'2:6': 'And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together and was confounded because each one heard them [a]speaking in his own dialect.',
'2:7': 'And they were [a]amazed and marveled, saying, Behold, are not all these who are speaking [b]Galileans?',
'2:8': 'And how <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>that</I> we each hear <I>them</I> in our own dialect in which we were born?',
'2:9': 'Parthians and [a]Medes and [b]Elamites and those dwelling in [c]Mesopotamia, both in Judea and [d]Cappadocia, in [e]Pontus and [f]Asia,',
'2:10': 'Both in [a]Phrygia and [b]Pamphylia, in [c]Egypt and the parts of [d]Libya around [e]Cyrene, and the sojourning of Rome, both Jews and [1]proselytes,',
'2:11': '[a]Cretans and [b]Arabians, we hear them speaking in our [1]tongues the magnificent <I>works</I> of God?',
'2:12': 'And they were all [a]amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, What does this mean?',
'2:13': 'But others [a]jeered and said, They are full of [1]new wine!',
'2:14': 'But Peter, standing with the [1]eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them: [2]Men of Judea, and all who are dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.',
'2:15': 'For these men are not [a]drunk, as you suppose, for it is the [1]third hour of the day;',
'2:16': 'But this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel:',
'2:17': '[a]&ldquo;And it shall be in the [1b]last days, says God, <I>that</I> I will [2c]pour out [3]of My Spirit [4]upon [5]all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall [6d]prophesy, and your young men shall see [e]visions, and your old men shall dream <I>things</I> in dreams;',
'2:18': 'And indeed upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My [a]Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.',
'2:19': 'And I will [1]show wonders in heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.',
'2:20': 'The [a]sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the [b]great and notable [1c]day of the Lord comes.',
'2:21': 'And it shall be that everyone who [1]calls on the [2]name of the Lord shall be [3a]saved.&rdquo;',
'2:22': '[1]Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the [a]Nazarene, a [2]man [3]shown by God to you to be approved by works of power and wonders and [b]signs, which God did through Him in your midst, even as you yourselves know&mdash;',
'2:23': 'This man, [a]delivered up by the [1b]determined counsel and [2]foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of [3]lawless men, [c]nailed to <I>a</I> [4]<I>cross</I> and [d]killed;',
'2:24': 'Whom [1]God has [a]raised up, having loosed the pangs of [b]death, since it was [2]not possible for Him to be held by it.',
'2:25': 'For David says regarding Him, [1a]&ldquo;I saw the [2]Lord continually before me, because [3]He is on my right hand, that I may not be shaken.',
'2:26': 'Therefore my heart was made glad and my [1]tongue exulted; moreover, also my flesh will [2]rest in hope,',
'2:27': 'Because You will not abandon my soul to [1a]Hades, nor will You permit Your [2b]Holy One to see [3]corruption.',
'2:28': 'You have made known to me the [1]ways of life; You will make me full of gladness with Your [2]presence.&rdquo;',
'2:29': '[1]Men, brothers, I can say to you plainly concerning the patriarch [a]David that he both deceased and was buried, and his [b]tomb is among us until this day.',
'2:30': 'Therefore, being a prophet and knowing that God had [a]sworn with an oath to him to seat <I>One</I> from the [1b]fruit of his loins upon his [2]throne,',
'2:31': 'He, seeing <I>this</I> beforehand, spoke concerning the resurrection of the Christ, that neither was He abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh see [a]corruption.',
'2:32': 'This Jesus [1]God has [a]raised up, of [2]which we all are [b]witnesses.',
'2:33': 'Therefore having been [a]exalted to the [b]right hand of God and having received the [1]promise of the Holy [c]Spirit from the Father, He has [d]poured out this which you both see and hear.',
'2:34': 'For David did [1]not [a]ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, [b]&ldquo;The [2]Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My [3]right hand',
'2:35': 'Until I [1]set Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.&rdquo;',
'2:36': 'Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both [1a]Lord and [b]Christ, this Jesus whom [2]you have [c]crucified.',
'2:37': 'And when they heard <I>this</I>, they were [a]pricked in their heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, [b]What should we do, [1]brothers?',
'2:38': 'And Peter said to them, [1a]Repent and each one of you be [2b]baptized [3]upon the [4]name of Jesus Christ for the [5c]forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the [6d]gift of the Holy [7]Spirit.',
'2:39': 'For to [1]you is the [2]promise and to your children, and to all [3]who are [a]far off, [4]as many as the Lord our God [b]calls to <I>Himself</I>.',
'2:40': 'And with many other words he solemnly [1a]testified and exhorted them, saying, [2]Be saved from this [b]crooked [3]generation.',
'2:41': 'Those then who received his word were [1]baptized, and there were [a]added on that day about three [b]thousand souls.',
'2:42': 'And they continued steadfastly in the [1]teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the [a]breaking of bread and the [b]prayers.',
'2:43': 'And [a]fear was upon every soul; and many [1]wonders and [b]signs took place through the apostles.',
'2:44': 'And all those who believed were together and had all things [1a]common;',
'2:45': 'And they [1a]sold their properties and possessions and [b]divided them to all, as anyone had need.',
'2:46': 'And day by day, continuing steadfastly with [a]one accord in the [1b]temple and [2c]breaking bread from [3d]house to house, they partook of <I>their</I> food with exultation and [4]simplicity of heart,',
'2:47': '[a]Praising God and [1]having grace with all the people. And the Lord [b]added [2]together [c]day by day those who were being [d]saved.',
'3:1': 'Now Peter and John were going up into the [1a]temple at the [2b]ninth-hour prayer;',
'3:2': 'And a certain man who had been [a]lame from his mother&rsquo;s womb was being carried <I>there</I>, whom they had laid day by day at the door of the temple which is called Beautiful to ask alms from those entering into the temple.',
'3:3': '<I>And</I> he, seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, began to ask to receive alms.',
'3:4': 'And Peter, gazing at him with John, said, Look at us!',
'3:5': 'And he turned his attention to them, expecting to receive something from them.',
'3:6': 'But Peter said, [1]Silver and gold I do [a]not possess, but what I have, this I give to you: In the [b]name of Jesus Christ the [2c]Nazarene [3]rise up and walk.',
'3:7': 'And he seized him by the right hand and raised him up; and instantly his feet and ankles were made strong.',
'3:8': 'And [a]leaping up and about, he stood and began to walk, and he entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and [b]praising God.',
'3:9': 'And all the [a]people saw him walking and praising God,',
'3:10': 'And they recognized him, that he was the one who had been sitting for alms at the temple&rsquo;s Beautiful Gate; and they were filled with amazement and astonishment at what had happened to him.',
'3:11': 'And while he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people ran together toward them at the [a]portico called Solomon&rsquo;s, greatly amazed.',
'3:12': 'And when Peter saw <I>this</I>, he replied to the people, [1]Men of Israel, why are you marveling at this? Or why are you gazing at us, as though by our own power or godliness we have made him walk?',
'3:13': 'The [1a]God of Abraham and [2]Isaac and Jacob, the God of our fathers, has [3b]glorified His [c]Servant Jesus, whom you [d]delivered up and [e]denied in the presence of [f]Pilate, when he had decided to [g]release <I>Him</I>.',
'3:14': 'But you denied the [a]holy and [b]righteous One and [c]asked that a man <I>who</I> <I>was</I> a murderer be granted to you;',
'3:15': 'And the [1]Author of [a]life you [b]killed, whom [2]God has [c]raised from the dead, of [3]which we are [d]witnesses.',
'3:16': 'And [1]upon faith in His [a]name, His [2]name has made this man strong, whom you behold and know; and the faith which is through Him has given him this wholeness <I>of</I> <I>health</I> before you all.',
'3:17': 'And now, brothers, I know that you acted in [a]ignorance, as also your rulers did;',
'3:18': 'But the things which God [1]announced beforehand through the mouth of all the prophets, that [a]His Christ would [b]suffer, He has thus fulfilled.',
'3:19': '[a]Repent therefore and turn, that your sins may be [b]wiped away,',
'3:20': 'So that seasons of [1]refreshing may come from the presence of the [2]Lord and that He may send the Christ, who has been previously [a]appointed for you, Jesus,',
'3:21': 'Whom heaven must indeed receive until the [1]times of the [a]restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of His holy [b]prophets [2]from of old.',
'3:22': 'Moses said, [a]&ldquo;A [1]Prophet will the Lord your God [b]raise up unto you from your brothers, like me; Him shall you [c]hear in whatever things He speaks to you.',
'3:23': '[a]And it shall be <I>that</I> every soul who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly [b]destroyed from among the people.&rdquo;',
'3:24': 'And also all the prophets, from [a]Samuel and those in succession after <I>him</I>, as many as spoke, also announced these days.',
'3:25': 'You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God covenanted with your fathers, saying to Abraham, &ldquo;And [a]in your [1]seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.&rdquo;',
'3:26': 'To you [a]first, God, having [b]raised up His [c]Servant, has sent [1]Him to bless you in [d]turning each <I>of</I> <I>you</I> away from your wicked deeds.',
'4:1': 'And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the [1a]captain of the temple and the [2b]Sadducees came upon them,',
'4:2': 'Being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and announcing [1]in Jesus the [a]resurrection from the dead.',
'4:3': 'And they [a]laid their hands on them and placed <I>them</I> in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.',
'4:4': 'But many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of men came to about five [a]thousand.',
'4:5': 'And on the next day their rulers and elders and scribes were [1]gathered together in Jerusalem,',
'4:6': 'As well as Annas the high priest and [1a]Caiaphas and [2]John and Alexander and as many as were of high-priestly descent.',
'4:7': 'And they stood them in the midst and inquired, [1]By what power or in what name did you do this?',
'4:8': 'Then Peter, [1]filled with the Holy [a]Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders,',
'4:9': 'If we today are being examined regarding a good deed <I>done</I> to a [a]sick man, by what means this man has been [1]healed,',
'4:10': 'Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the [a]name of Jesus Christ the [1]Nazarene, whom [2]you [b]crucified <I>and</I> whom [3]God has [c]raised from the dead, in this <I>name</I> this man stands before you in good health.',
'4:11': 'This is the [1]stone which was [2]considered as nothing by you, the builders, which has become the [3a]head of the corner.',
'4:12': 'And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another [a]name under heaven given among men in which we must be [b]saved.',
'4:13': 'And as they beheld the [a]boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were [1b]uneducated men and [2]laymen, they marveled and they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.',
'4:14': 'And seeing the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against <I>it</I>.',
'4:15': 'But they ordered them to go away outside the [1a]Sanhedrin and conferred with one another,',
'4:16': 'Saying, What shall we do to these men? For that indeed a notable [a]sign has occurred through them is manifest to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny <I>it</I>.',
'4:17': 'But in order that this would not be spread further among the people, let us threaten them that they no longer speak based upon this name to anyone.',
'4:18': 'And when they called them, they charged <I>them</I> [a]not to utter <I>anything</I> at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus.',
'4:19': 'But Peter and John answered and said to them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you [a]rather than to God, you judge;',
'4:20': 'For we cannot but speak the things which we have [a]seen and heard.',
'4:21': 'And when they had further threatened <I>them</I>, they released them, finding no way that they could punish them on account of the [a]people, because they all were glorifying God for what had happened;',
'4:22': 'For the man on whom this sign of healing had occurred was more than forty years old.',
'4:23': 'And when they had been released, they went to their [1]own <I>people</I> and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said to them.',
'4:24': 'And when they heard <I>this</I>, they lifted up <I>their</I> voice with [a]one accord to God and said, [1]Sovereign Master, You are the One who has [b]made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them,',
'4:25': 'Who, through the Holy Spirit, <I>through</I> the mouth of our father David Your servant, has said, [a]&ldquo;Why did the Gentiles [1]rage, and the peoples devise vain things?',
'4:26': 'The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against [a]His Christ.&rdquo;',
'4:27': 'For truly in this city there were [a]gathered together against Your holy [b]Servant Jesus, whom You [c]anointed, both Herod and [d]Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,',
'4:28': 'To [a]do what Your hand and Your counsel [1]predestined to take place.',
'4:29': 'And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings and grant Your slaves to speak Your word with all [a]boldness,',
'4:30': 'While [a]stretching out Your hand to heal, and that [b]signs and wonders may take place through the [c]name of Your [d]holy Servant Jesus.',
'4:31': 'And when they had <I>so</I> besought, the place in which they were gathered was [a]shaken, and they were all [1]filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with [b]boldness.',
'4:32': 'And the [a]heart and [b]soul of the multitude of those who had believed was one; and [1]not even one said that any of his possessions was his own, but all things were [2]common to them.',
'4:33': 'And with great [a]power the apostles gave [1b]testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great [2c]grace was upon them all.',
'4:34': 'For [a]neither was anyone among them in need; for as many as were owners of lands or of houses [1]sold <I>them</I> and brought the proceeds of the things which were sold',
'4:35': 'And placed <I>them</I> at the [a]feet of the apostles; and it was [b]distributed to each, as anyone had need.',
'4:36': 'And Joseph, who was surnamed [1a]Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated, Son of encouragement), a [b]Levite, a [c]Cyprian by birth,',
'4:37': 'Who possessed a field, sold <I>it</I> and brought the sum of money and placed <I>it</I> at the feet of the apostles.',
'5:1': 'But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property',
'5:2': 'And put aside for himself some of the proceeds, his wife also being aware of it. And he brought some part <I>of</I> <I>it</I> and laid <I>it</I> at the [a]feet of the apostles.',
'5:3': 'But Peter said, Ananias, why has [a]Satan filled your heart to deceive the [1]Holy [b]Spirit and to put aside for yourself some of the proceeds of the land?',
'5:4': 'While it remained, [1]was it not your own? And when it was sold, [1]was it not under your authority? Why <I>is</I> <I>it</I> that you have [2]contrived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to [3]God.',
'5:5': 'And when Ananias heard these words, he [a]fell down and [1]expired; and great [b]fear came upon all those who heard <I>this</I>.',
'5:6': 'And the young men arose and wrapped him up; and carrying <I>him</I> out, they buried <I>him</I>.',
'5:7': 'And it happened that after an interval of about three hours, his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.',
'5:8': 'And Peter answered her, Tell me whether you have sold the land for this much? And she said, Yes, for this much.',
'5:9': 'And Peter <I>said</I> to her, Why <I>is</I> <I>it</I> that it was [1]agreed between you <I>two</I> to [a]test the [b]Spirit of the [2]Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.',
'5:10': 'And she [a]fell down instantly at his feet and expired. And the young men came in and found her dead; and carrying <I>her</I> out, they buried <I>her</I> with her husband.',
'5:11': 'And great [a]fear came upon the whole [1b]church and upon all those who heard these things.',
'5:12': 'And through the hands of the apostles many [1]signs and wonders took place among the people; and they were all with one [a]accord in the [b]portico of Solomon.',
'5:13': 'And none of the rest dared to join themselves to them, but the [a]people magnified them.',
'5:14': 'And believers were all the more being added [a]to the Lord, [b]multitudes of both men and women,',
'5:15': 'So that they even carried the sick out into the [a]streets and placed <I>them</I> on cots and mats, in order that when Peter came, at least his shadow might [b]overshadow some of them.',
'5:16': 'And the multitude from the cities surrounding Jerusalem also came together, carrying the [a]sick and those troubled by unclean spirits, for such ones were all being healed.',
'5:17': 'And the high priest and all those with him, the local [a]sect of the [b]Sadducees, rose up and were filled with [c]jealousy;',
'5:18': 'And they [a]laid their hands on the apostles and put them in public custody.',
'5:19': 'But during the night an [a]angel of the Lord [b]opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out, said,',
'5:20': 'Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the [1a]words of [2]this life.',
'5:21': 'And when they heard <I>this</I>, they entered about daybreak into the temple and began to teach. And the [a]high priest and those with him came up and called together the [b]Sanhedrin, [1]even all the council of elders of the sons of Israel, and sent <I>men</I> to the prison for them to be brought.',
'5:22': 'But when the officers arrived, they did not find them in the prison; and they returned and reported,',
'5:23': 'Saying, The prison we found locked with all security, and the guards standing at the doors; but when we opened <I>the</I> <I>doors</I>, we found no one inside.',
'5:24': 'Now when they heard these words, both the [1a]captain of the temple and the chief priests were utterly perplexed concerning them <I>as</I> <I>to</I> what this would come to.',
'5:25': 'And someone came up and reported to them, Behold, the men whom you put in the prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.',
'5:26': 'Then the captain with the officers went away and brought them without violence, for they feared the [a]people, lest they would be [b]stoned.',
'5:27': 'And having brought them, they stood <I>them</I> in the [a]Sanhedrin. And the high priest questioned them,',
'5:28': 'Saying, We [1]strictly charged you [a]not to teach based upon this name; and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this man&rsquo;s [b]blood upon us.',
'5:29': 'But Peter and the apostles answered and said, It is necessary to obey God [a]rather than men.',
'5:30': 'The [1]God of our [a]fathers has [b]raised Jesus, whom you slew by hanging <I>Him</I> on a [c]tree.',
'5:31': 'This One God has [1a]exalted to His [b]right hand as [2]Leader and [c]Savior, to [3]give [4d]repentance to Israel and [e]forgiveness of sins.',
'5:32': 'And we are [a]witnesses of these [1]things, and <I>so</I> <I>is</I> the Holy [2b]Spirit, whom God has given to those who [3]obey Him.',
'5:33': 'But when they [a]heard <I>this</I>, they were [1]exasperated and intended to do away with them.',
'5:34': 'But a certain [1]Pharisee in the [a]Sanhedrin named [b]Gamaliel, a [c]teacher of the law honored by all the people, stood up and commanded that they put the men outside for a little while.',
'5:35': 'And he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves, with regard to these men, in what you are about to do.',
'5:36': 'For before these days Theudas rose up, saying that he was somebody, with whom a number of men, about four hundred, took sides. And he was done away with, and all who were persuaded by him were dispersed and came to nothing.',
'5:37': 'After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the [a]enrollment and drew away <I>a</I> <I>group</I> <I>of</I> people after him. And that man perished, and all who were persuaded by him were scattered.',
'5:38': 'And now I say to you, withdraw from these men and leave them alone; for should this [a]counsel or this work be of men, it will be overthrown;',
'5:39': 'But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them, lest you be found to be even [a]fighters against God.',
'5:40': 'And they were persuaded by him. And having called the apostles to <I>them</I>, they [a]beat <I>them</I> and charged <I>them</I> [b]not to speak based upon the name of Jesus; and they released <I>them</I>.',
'5:41': 'So they went from the presence of the [a]Sanhedrin, [b]rejoicing that they were counted worthy [1]to be dishonored on behalf of the [c]Name.',
'5:42': 'And every day, in the [1]temple and from [2]house to house, they did not cease teaching and [a]announcing the gospel of [3]Jesus <I>as</I> the [b]Christ.',
'6:1': 'And in these days, as the disciples were [a]multiplying <I>in</I> <I>number</I>, a murmuring of the [1b]Hellenists against the [2]Hebrews occurred, because their [c]widows were being overlooked in the daily [d]dispensing.',
'6:2': 'And the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to <I>them</I> and said, It is not [1]fitting for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.',
'6:3': 'But brothers, look for seven [a]well-attested men from among you, [1]full of the [b]Spirit and of [2c]wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need.',
'6:4': 'But we will continue steadfastly in [1a]prayer and in the [b]ministry of the word.',
'6:5': 'And the word pleased all the multitude; and they chose Stephen, a man full of [a]faith and of the Holy [b]Spirit, and [c]Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a [1]proselyte of Antioch,',
'6:6': 'Whom they set before the apostles; and when they had [a]prayed, they [1b]laid their hands on [2]them.',
'6:7': 'And the word of God [1a]grew, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem [b]multiplied greatly; and a large number of the priests [c]obeyed the [2d]faith.',
'6:8': 'And Stephen, full of grace and [a]power, did great [1]wonders and signs among the people.',
'6:9': 'But some of those of the [1]synagogue which is called the <I>synagogue</I> of the [2]Libertines and of the Cyrenians and of the Alexandrians and of those from Cilicia and Asia rose up and disputed with Stephen;',
'6:10': 'Yet they were not able to [a]withstand the wisdom and the [b]Spirit with which he spoke.',
'6:11': 'Then they instigated some men to [a]say, We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.',
'6:12': 'And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon <I>him</I> and seized him and led <I>him</I> to the [1]Sanhedrin.',
'6:13': 'And they set up [a]false [b]witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words [c]against this holy [1]place and the law,',
'6:14': 'For we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will [1]destroy this place and will change the [a]customs which Moses delivered to us.',
'6:15': 'And all those sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw his face as though <I>it</I> <I>were</I> the [1]face of an angel.',
'7:1': 'And the high priest said, Are these things so?',
'7:2': 'And he said, [1]Men, [a]brothers and fathers, listen. The God of [2b]glory appeared to our father Abraham while he was in [c]Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in [d]Haran,',
'7:3': 'And said to him, [a]&ldquo;Come out from your land and from your relatives, and come into the land which I will show you.&rdquo;',
'7:4': 'Then he [a]came forth from the land of the [b]Chaldeans and dwelt in Haran. And from there, after his father [c]died, He [1]removed him into this land, in which you now dwell.',
'7:5': 'Yet He did not give him an inheritance in it, not even a place to set his foot on; and He [a]promised to give it to him for a possession and to his [b]seed after him, while he had [c]no child.',
'7:6': 'And God spoke in this way that his seed would be a [a]sojourner in a [1]foreign land, and [2]they would [b]enslave them and mistreat <I>them</I> [3c]four hundred years.',
'7:7': '&ldquo;And whatever nation they will [a]serve as slaves I will judge,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;and after these things they will come forth and [b]serve Me as priests in this place.&rdquo;',
'7:8': 'And He gave to him a [a]covenant of circumcision; and thus <I>Abraham</I> begot [b]Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac, [c]Jacob; and Jacob, the [d]twelve patriarchs.',
'7:9': 'And the patriarchs became [a]jealous of Joseph and [b]sold <I>him</I> into Egypt; yet God was [c]with him',
'7:10': 'And rescued him out of all his afflictions and granted him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he [a]appointed him governor over Egypt and over all his house.',
'7:11': 'And a [a]famine came over all Egypt and Canaan as well as great affliction; and our fathers could find no [1]sustenance.',
'7:12': 'But when Jacob heard that there was [a]grain in Egypt, he sent our fathers out the first time.',
'7:13': 'And during the second time Joseph was [a]made known to his brothers, and Joseph&rsquo;s race became manifest to [b]Pharaoh.',
'7:14': 'And Joseph sent <I>word</I> and called for Jacob his [a]father and all his family, [1]seventy-five souls in all.',

'7:16': 'And they were carried over to Shechem and placed in the tomb which Abraham had [a]bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.',
'7:17': 'But as the time of the [a]promise which God had assured to Abraham drew near, the people grew and were [b]multiplied in Egypt,',
'7:18': 'Until [1]another [a]king rose up over Egypt who did not know of Joseph.',
'7:19': 'This one dealt [a]craftily with our race and mistreated our fathers, so that they threw out their [b]babies in order that they would not be kept alive.',
'7:20': 'At this time [1]Moses was born and was [2]lovely to God. And he was nurtured [a]three months in his father&rsquo;s house.',
'7:21': 'And when he was [1]thrown out, Pharaoh&rsquo;s [a]daughter took him up and nurtured him as a son for herself.',
'7:22': 'And Moses was educated in all the [1a]wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in his words and works.',
'7:23': 'But when he was approaching forty years of age, it came into his heart to visit his [a]brothers, the sons of Israel.',
'7:24': 'And when he saw one <I>of</I> <I>them</I> being wronged, he defended <I>him</I>, and he avenged him who was being oppressed by striking the Egyptian dead.',
'7:25': 'And he supposed that his brothers understood that God through his hand was giving salvation to them; but they did not understand.',
'7:26': 'And on the following day he appeared to them as they were [a]fighting and tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, [1]Men, you are brothers. Why are you wronging one another?',
'7:27': 'But the one who was wronging his neighbor pushed him away, saying, [a]&ldquo;Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?',
'7:28': 'Do you want to do away with me the same way you did away with the Egyptian yesterday?&rdquo;',
'7:29': 'And Moses [a]fled at this word and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begot two [b]sons.',

'7:37': 'This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, [a]&ldquo;A Prophet will God raise up unto you from your brothers, like me.&rdquo;',
'7:38': 'This is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the [a]Angel who spoke to him in [b]Mount Sinai and <I>with</I> our fathers, <I>and</I> who received living [c]oracles to give to us.',
'7:39': 'To him our fathers were not willing to become obedient, but thrust <I>him</I> away and [a]turned in their hearts to Egypt,',
'7:40': 'Saying to Aaron, [a]&ldquo;Make gods for us who will go before us; for this Moses, who has led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.&rdquo;',
'7:41': 'And they made a [1a]calf in those days and brought up a sacrifice to the idol and were glad with the works of their hands.',
'7:42': 'But God turned and [a]delivered them up to [1]serve the [2b]host of heaven, even as it is written in the [3]book of the prophets, [c]&ldquo;Did you offer slain beasts and sacrifices to Me for [d]forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?',
'7:43': 'And you took up the [1]tabernacle of [a]Moloch and the star of your god [2]Rompha, the images which you made to worship. And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.&rdquo;',
'7:44': 'The [a]Tabernacle of the [b]Testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, even as He who spoke to Moses instructed <I>him</I> to make it, according to the [c]pattern which he had seen.',
'7:45': 'This <I>tabernacle</I> our fathers, having in their turn received, also brought in with [a]Joshua when they took [b]possession of the nations, whom God [c]drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of [d]David,',

'7:58': 'And they threw <I>him</I> [a]outside of the city and [b]stoned <I>him</I>. And the [c]witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called [1d]Saul.',
'7:59': 'And they stoned Stephen as he [1]called upon <I>the</I> <I>Lord</I> and said, Lord Jesus, receive my [a]spirit!',

'8:1': 'And Saul [a]approved of his killing. And there occurred in that day a great [b]persecution against the [1c]church which was in Jerusalem; and all were [d]scattered throughout the regions of [e]Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.',
'8:2': 'And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him.',
'8:3': 'But [a]Saul was [b]devastating the [c]church, entering house after house; and dragging off men and women, he delivered <I>them</I> to [d]prison.',
'8:4': 'Those therefore who were scattered went throughout <I>the</I> <I>land</I> [1a]announcing the word as the gospel.',
'8:5': 'And [1]Philip [2]went down to the city of [a]Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.',

'8:7': 'For with many of those who had unclean spirits, <I>the</I> <I>spirits</I> came out crying with a loud voice; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.',
'8:8': 'And there was much [a]joy in that city.',
'8:9': 'And a certain man named Simon had previously been practicing [a]magic in the city and had been [b]amazing the people of Samaria, saying that he was someone great.',
'8:10': 'To him they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the power of [a]God which is called Great.',
'8:11': 'And they gave heed to him because for a considerable time he had amazed them with his magic.',
'8:12': 'But when they believed Philip, who [1]announced the gospel of the [a]kingdom of God and of the name of [b]Jesus Christ, they were [c]baptized, both men and women.',
'8:13': 'And even Simon himself believed, and once he had been baptized, he continued steadfastly with Philip. And as he beheld the [1a]signs and great works of power taking place, he was [b]amazed.',
'8:14': 'Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,',
'8:15': 'Who went down and prayed for them so that they might [1]receive the Holy Spirit;',
'8:16': 'For He had [1]not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been [a]baptized [2]into the [3]name of the Lord Jesus.',
'8:17': 'Then they [1a]laid their hands on them, and they [2]received the Holy Spirit.',
'8:18': 'But when Simon saw that through the laying on of the hands of the apostles the [1]Spirit was given, he offered them [2]money, saying,',
'8:19': 'Give me also this authority that on whomever I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Spirit.',
'8:20': 'But Peter said to him, May your silver go with you into [1]destruction, because you thought that you would [a]acquire the [b]gift of God through money.',
'8:21': 'You have no part nor lot in [1]this matter, for your [a]heart is not straight before God.',
'8:22': '[a]Repent therefore from this wickedness of yours and beseech the Lord if perhaps the intent of your heart may be forgiven you;',
'8:23': 'For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of unrighteousness.',
'8:24': 'And Simon answered and said, You beseech the Lord on my behalf, so that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me.',
'8:25': 'They therefore, having solemnly [1a]testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem; and they [b]announced the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.',
'8:26': 'But an [a]angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to [b]Gaza. This is the desert <I>route</I>.',
'8:27': 'And he rose up and went. And behold, an [1]Ethiopian man, a [a]eunuch, a man in power under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her [b]treasure, had come to Jerusalem to [2c]worship.',
'8:28': 'And he was returning and was sitting in his chariot and reading the prophet Isaiah.',
'8:29': 'And the [1a]Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.',
'8:30': 'And when Philip ran up, he heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said, Do you really know the things that you are reading?',
'8:31': 'And he said, How could I [a]unless someone guides me? And he entreated Philip to come up and sit with him.',
'8:32': 'Now the passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: &ldquo;As a sheep [1a]He was led to slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so He does [b]not open His mouth.',
'8:33': 'In His [a]humiliation His judgment was taken away. Who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth.&rdquo;',
'8:34': 'And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I beseech you, Concerning whom does the prophet say this? Concerning himself or concerning someone else?',
'8:35': 'And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this [a]Scripture he [b]announced Jesus as the gospel to him.',
'8:36': 'And as they were going along the road, they came upon some water, and the eunuch said, Look, [1]water. What prevents me from being [a]baptized?',
'8:37': '[1]And Philip said, If you believe from all your heart, you will be saved. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.',
'8:38': 'And he ordered the chariot to stand still, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he [a]baptized him.',
'8:39': 'And when they came up [a]out of the water, the [b]Spirit of the Lord [c]caught Philip away; and the eunuch did not see him anymore, for he went on his way [d]rejoicing.',
'8:40': 'But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he [a]announced the gospel to all the cities until he came to [b]Caesarea.',
'9:1': 'But [a]Saul, still breathing threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest',
'9:2': 'And asked for [a]letters from him to Damascus for the [b]synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the [1c]Way, both men and women, he might bring <I>them</I> bound to Jerusalem.',
'9:3': 'And as he went, he [a]drew near to Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.',
'9:4': 'And he fell on the ground and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting [1a]Me?',
'9:5': 'And he said, Who are You, [1]Lord? And He <I>said</I>, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.',
'9:6': 'But [a]rise up and enter into the city, and it [1]will be told to you [b]what you must do.',
'9:7': 'And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, [a]hearing the voice but seeing no one.',
'9:8': 'And Saul rose from the ground; and though his eyes were open, he could see [1]nothing. And they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.',
'9:9': 'And he was three days without seeing, and he neither ate nor drank.',
'9:10': 'And there was a certain disciple in Damascus named [a]Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, [b]I <I>am</I> <I>here</I>, Lord.',
'9:11': 'And the Lord <I>said</I> to him, [a]Rise up and [1]go to the lane called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas a man from [b]Tarsus named Saul; for behold, he is praying;',
'9:12': 'And he has seen in a [a]vision a man named Ananias coming in and [b]laying his hands on him so that he may [1c]receive his sight.',
'9:13': 'But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things he has done to Your [a]saints in Jerusalem;',
'9:14': 'And here he has [a]authority from the chief priests to bind all who [1b]call upon Your name.',
'9:15': 'But the Lord said to him, Go, for this man is a [1]chosen [a]vessel to Me, to bear My [b]name before both the [c]Gentiles and [d]kings and the sons of Israel;',
'9:16': 'For I will show him how [a]many things he must suffer on behalf of My name.',
'9:17': 'And [a]Ananias went away and entered into the house; and [1b]laying his hands on him, he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me&mdash;Jesus, who appeared to you on the road on which you were coming&mdash;so that you may [c]receive your sight and be [2]filled with the Holy Spirit.',
'9:18': 'And immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he [1]received his sight and rose up and was [2a]baptized.',
'9:19': 'And once he had taken food, he was strengthened. And he was with the disciples in [a]Damascus for some days.',
'9:20': 'And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the [1]synagogues, that this One is the [a]Son of God.',
'9:21': 'And all who heard <I>him</I> were amazed and said, Is this not the one who [a]ravaged those who [b]call upon this name in Jerusalem and came here for this, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests?',
'9:22': 'But Saul was all the more [a]empowered, and he [b]confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus by proving that this One is the [c]Christ.',
'9:23': 'And as a considerable number of days were being fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to [a]do away with him;',
'9:24': 'But their [a]plot was made known to Saul. And they also [b]watched the gates closely, both day and night, so that they might [c]do away with him.',
'9:25': 'But his disciples took <I>him</I> by night and [a]let him down through the wall, [b]lowering <I>him</I> in a basket.',
'9:26': 'And when he arrived in [a]Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; yet all feared him, not believing that he was a disciple.',
'9:27': 'But [a]Barnabas took hold of him and [b]led <I>him</I> to the apostles, and he related to them how <I>Saul</I> had [c]seen the Lord on the road, and that He had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken [d]boldly in the name of Jesus.',
'9:28': 'And he was with them, [a]going in and going out in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord.',
'9:29': 'And he spoke and disputed with the [a]Hellenists, but they attempted to [b]do away with him.',
'9:30': 'But when the [a]brothers realized <I>it</I>, they brought him down to [b]Caesarea and sent him forth to [c]Tarsus.',
'9:31': 'So then the [1a]church throughout the whole of [b]Judea and Galilee and Samaria had [2]peace, [3]being built up; and going on in the [4c]fear of the Lord and in the [5]comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was [d]multiplied.',
'9:32': 'Now as Peter was passing through all <I>those</I> <I>parts</I>, he came down also to the [a]saints dwelling at [1]Lydda.',
'9:33': 'And he found there a certain man named Aeneas, who for eight years had been lying on a mat, <I>for</I> he was [a]paralyzed.',
'9:34': 'And Peter said to him, Aeneas, [a]Jesus Christ heals you. [b]Rise up and [1]make up your own bed. And immediately he rose up.',
'9:35': 'And all those dwelling in Lydda and [a]Sharon saw him; and they [b]turned to the Lord.',
'9:36': 'Now in [a]Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha (which, when translated, is [1]Dorcas); this woman was full of [b]good works and alms which she did.',
'9:37': 'And in those days she became ill and died; and they bathed [1]her body and laid <I>it</I> in an [a]upper room.',
'9:38': 'Now because Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was [1]there, and they sent two men to him, entreating <I>him</I>, Do not delay to come through to us.',
'9:39': 'And Peter rose up and went with them. When he arrived, they led him up into the upper room. And all the [a]widows stood by him, weeping and showing <I>him</I> [1]tunics and garments, all of which Dorcas had made while she was with them.',
'9:40': 'And Peter put <I>them</I> all [a]outside; and [b]kneeling down, he [c]prayed; and he turned to the body and said, Tabitha, [d]rise up. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.',
'9:41': 'And giving her <I>his</I> hand, he raised her up. And when he had called the saints and the widows, he [a]presented her alive.',
'9:42': 'And it became known throughout all of Joppa and many [a]believed on the Lord.',
'9:43': 'And he remained a considerable number of days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a [a]tanner.',

'10:4': 'And he looked intently at him and became terrified and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your [a]prayers and your alms have ascended as a [1b]memorial before God.',
'10:5': 'And now send men to Joppa and send for a certain Simon, who is surnamed Peter;',
'10:6': 'This man is lodging with a certain Simon, a [a]tanner, whose house is by the sea.',
'10:7': 'And when the angel who was speaking to him went away, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those who waited on him;',
'10:8': 'And relating all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.',
'10:9': 'And on the next day as they were journeying and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the [a]housetop to [1b]pray around the [2]sixth hour.',
'10:10': 'And he became very [1]hungry and wanted to [2]eat. And while they were preparing, a [3a]trance came upon him;',
'10:11': 'And he beheld [1]heaven [a]opened, and a certain [2]vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners onto the earth,',
'10:12': 'In which were all the four-footed [1]animals and reptiles of the earth and birds of heaven.',
'10:13': 'And a voice came to him: Rise up, Peter; slay and [1]eat!',
'10:14': 'But Peter said, By no means, Lord, for I have [1a]never eaten anything [b]common and [c]unclean.',
'10:15': 'And a voice <I>came</I> to him again a second time: The [1]things that God has [a]cleansed, do not make common.',
'10:16': 'And this occurred three times; and immediately the vessel was taken up into heaven.',
'10:17': 'Now as Peter was utterly perplexed in himself <I>as</I> <I>to</I> what the [1a]vision which he had seen might be, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made diligent inquiry for Simon&rsquo;s house, stood at the gate.',
'10:18': 'And they called out and inquired whether Simon, who is surnamed Peter, was lodging there.',
'10:19': 'And while Peter was pondering over the vision, the [a]Spirit said to him, Behold, <I>there</I> <I>are</I> three men seeking you.',
'10:20': 'But rise up, go down and go with them, doubting nothing, because [1]I have sent them.',
'10:21': 'And Peter went down to the men and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek; what is the cause for which you have come?',
'10:22': 'And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man and one who [a]fears God and is [b]well attested to by the whole nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a [c]holy angel to send for you <I>to</I> <I>come</I> to his house and hear [d]words from you.',
'10:23': 'So he called them in and lodged <I>them</I>. And on the next day he rose up and went away with them; and [1a]some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.',
'10:24': 'And on the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was awaiting them, having called together his relatives and intimate friends.',
'10:25': 'And when Peter entered, Cornelius met him, and [a]falling at his feet, worshipped <I>him</I>.',
'10:26': 'But Peter raised him up, saying, Rise up; I myself am also a [a]man.',
'10:27': 'And as he talked with him, he entered and found many who had come together.',
'10:28': 'And he said to them, You understand that it is unlawful for a man <I>who</I> <I>is</I> a Jew to join himself to or come near one of [a]another race; yet God has shown me that I should not call any [1]man [b]common or unclean.',
'10:29': 'Hence, even without objection I came when I had been sent for. I ask therefore, For what reason have you sent for me?',
'10:30': 'And Cornelius said, Four days ago to this hour I was praying at the ninth hour in my house, and behold, a man stood before me [a]in bright clothing,',
'10:31': 'And he said, Cornelius, your prayer has been [a]heard and your alms have been [b]remembered before God.',
'10:32': 'Send therefore to Joppa and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; this man is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.',
'10:33': 'Therefore I sent <I>men</I> at once to you, and you have done nobly in coming. Now therefore we all are present before God to hear all the things that have been commanded to you by the Lord.',
'10:34': 'And opening his mouth, Peter said, In truth I perceive that God is not a [a]respecter of persons,',
'10:35': 'But in [a]every nation he who [b]fears Him and works [c]righteousness is [1]acceptable to Him.',
'10:36': 'The word which He sent to the sons of Israel in announcing the gospel of [a]peace through Jesus Christ (this One is [b]Lord of [1]all)',
'10:37': 'You yourselves know, [1]the word which has been spoken throughout the whole of Judea, beginning from [a]Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed:',
'10:38': 'Jesus, the One from [a]Nazareth, how God [b]anointed Him with the Holy [c]Spirit and with [d]power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were being [e]oppressed by the devil, for God was [f]with Him.',
'10:39': 'And we are [a]witnesses of all the things which He did, both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom also they [b]did away with by hanging <I>Him</I> on a [c]tree.',
'10:40': 'This One, [1]God [a]raised on the [b]third day; and He has made Him [2c]manifest,',
'10:41': 'Not to all the people, but to [a]witnesses appointed beforehand by God, to us, ones who [b]ate and drank with Him after [1]He rose from the dead.',
'10:42': 'And He has [a]charged us to proclaim to the people and solemnly [b]testify that this is the One who was designated by God to be the [1c]Judge of the [d]living and the dead.',
'10:43': 'To this One all the [a]prophets testify that through His [b]name everyone who [c]believes into Him will receive [1d]forgiveness of sins.',
'10:44': 'While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy [a]Spirit [1]fell upon all those [2]hearing the word.',
'10:45': 'And the believers <I>who</I> <I>were</I> of the [a]circumcision, [b]as many as had accompanied Peter, were amazed, because on the [c]Gentiles also the [1d]gift of the Holy Spirit had been [2]poured out;',
'10:46': 'For they heard them [1a]speaking in tongues and [2]magnifying God. Then Peter answered,',
'10:47': 'Can anyone forbid the water so that these would not be [a]baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit even [1b]as we?',
'10:48': 'And he charged them to be [1]baptized [2]in the [3]name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.',
'11:1': 'And the apostles and the [a]brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.',
'11:2': 'And when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those of the [1a]circumcision disputed with him,',
'11:3': 'Saying, You went in to men who are uncircumcised and [a]ate [b]with them.',
'11:4': 'And Peter began, and he explained to them in sequence, saying,',
'11:5': 'I was in the city of Joppa [a]praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel like a great sheet descending, being let down by four corners out of heaven; and it came unto me.',
'11:6': 'Looking intently into it, I examined <I>it</I> and saw the four-footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the reptiles and the birds of heaven.',
'11:7': 'And I also heard a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter; slay and eat!',
'11:8': 'But I said, By no means, Lord, for no common or unclean thing has ever entered into my mouth.',
'11:9': 'And a voice answered a second time out of heaven, The things that God has cleansed, do not make common.',
'11:10': 'And this occurred three times, and everything was drawn up again into heaven.',
'11:11': 'And behold, at that moment three men stood at the house in which we were, having been sent from Caesarea to me.',
'11:12': 'And the Spirit told me to go with them, [1]doubting nothing. And [2]these [a]six brothers went with me also; and we entered into the man&rsquo;s house.',
'11:13': 'And he reported to us how he saw the angel standing in his house and saying, Send <I>men</I> to Joppa and send for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,',
'11:14': 'Who will speak words to you by which you shall be saved, you and all your [1]house.',
'11:15': 'And as I began to speak, the Holy [a]Spirit fell on them just as also on us [b]in the beginning.',
'11:16': 'And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, [a]John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.',
'11:17': 'If therefore God has given to them the equal [a]gift [b]as also to us who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, [c]who was I that I could have forbidden God?',
'11:18': 'And when they heard these things, they became silent and [a]glorified God, saying, Then to the [b]Gentiles also God has given [c]repentance unto [1]life.',
'11:19': 'Those then who were [1a]scattered by the tribulation which took place on account of Stephen passed through as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to [2]no one except Jews only.',
'11:20': 'But there were some of them, [1]men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and [2]spoke also to the [a]Greeks, [b]announcing the Lord Jesus as the gospel.',
'11:21': 'And the [a]hand of the Lord was with them, and a [b]great number who believed [c]turned to the Lord.',
'11:22': 'And the account concerning them was heard in the ears of the [a]church which was in Jerusalem, and they [1]sent out [2]Barnabas to pass through as far as Antioch,',
'11:23': 'Who, when he arrived and saw the [1a]grace of God, [b]rejoiced and encouraged them all to [2]remain with the Lord with [c]purpose of heart;',
'11:24': 'For he was a good man and [1]full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a [a]considerable [2]number was [b]added to the Lord.',
'11:25': 'And he went forth to [a]Tarsus to search for Saul;',
'11:26': 'And when he found him, he brought him to [a]Antioch. And it happened with them that for a whole year they were gathered in the [b]church and taught a considerable number and that the disciples were first called [1c]Christians in Antioch.',
'11:27': 'And in these days [1a]prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.',
'11:28': 'And one of them named [a]Agabus rose up and signified through the [b]Spirit that there was about to be a great [c]famine over the whole inhabited earth, which occurred during the time of [1d]Claudius.',
'11:29': 'And the [1]disciples, according to how one was [2]prospered, determined, each one of them, to [a]send <I>things</I> [3]for [b]dispensing to the [c]brothers dwelling in Judea,',
'11:30': 'Which also they did, sending <I>it</I> to the [1a]elders through the hand of [b]Barnabas and [2]Saul.',
'12:1': 'Now about that time [1]Herod the king laid hands on some from the [a]church in order to [b]mistreat them.',
'12:2': 'And he [a]did away with [b]James, the brother of John, with the [c]sword.',
'12:3': 'And when he saw that it was [a]pleasing to the Jews, he went on to arrest Peter also (now <I>those</I> were the days of [b]Unleavened Bread),',
'12:4': 'Whom also he [a]seized and put in [b]prison, delivering him to four [1]quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after the [c]Passover to bring him out to the people.',
'12:5': 'So then Peter was kept in the prison;<br class="split">but [a]prayer was being made fervently by the [b]church to God concerning him.',
'12:6': 'And when Herod was about to bring him forward, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, [a]bound with two chains; and guards before the door were keeping the prison.',
'12:7': 'And behold, an [a]angel of the Lord [b]stood by <I>him</I>, and a light shined in the cell; and he [c]struck Peter&rsquo;s side and roused him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his [d]chains fell off his hands.',
'12:8': 'And the angel said to him, Gird yourself and tie on your [a]sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Throw your cloak around <I>you</I> and follow me.',
'12:9': 'And he went out and followed <I>him</I>; yet he did not know that what was taking place through the angel was real, but thought that he was seeing a [a]vision.',
'12:10': 'And passing the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which [a]opened of itself to them. And going out, they went forward one lane; and immediately the angel departed from him.',
'12:11': 'And Peter [1]came to himself and said, Now I know truly that the Lord has sent forth His [a]angel and [b]rescued me out of Herod&rsquo;s hand and from all the expectation of the Jewish people.',
'12:12': 'And when he became aware of <I>this</I>, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of [a]John, who was surnamed Mark, where there was a considerable number assembled together and [b]praying.',
'12:13': 'And when he knocked at the door of the entry, a maiden named Rhoda came to listen.',
'12:14': 'And when she recognized Peter&rsquo;s voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but ran in and reported that Peter was standing before the entry.',
'12:15': 'But they said to her, You are crazy! But she insisted that it was so. And they said, It is [1]his angel.',
'12:16': 'But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened <I>the</I> <I>gate</I>, they saw him and were beside themselves.',
'12:17': 'And [a]motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison, and he said, Report these things to [1b]James and the [c]brothers. And going out, he went to another place.',
'12:18': 'Now when it became day, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, <I>they</I> <I>not</I> <I>knowing</I> what had become of Peter.',
'12:19': 'And when Herod searched for him and did not find <I>him</I>,<br class="split">he examined the guards and ordered that they be led off <I>to</I> <I>execution</I>. And he went down from Judea to [a]Caesarea and spent time <I>there</I>.',
'12:20': 'Now he was furious with the Tyrians and Sidonians. And they came to him with one accord; and having persuaded Blastus, the king&rsquo;s [1]chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country was [a]fed from the king&rsquo;s <I>country</I>.',
'12:21': 'And on an appointed day Herod arrayed himself in royal clothing and sat on the judgment seat; and he delivered a public address to them.',
'12:22': 'And the populace cried out, The voice of a god and not of a man!',
'12:23': 'And instantly an [a]angel of the Lord struck him because he did not give the [b]glory to God; and he was eaten by [c]worms and [1]expired.',
'12:24': 'But the word of [1]God [a]grew and multiplied.',
'12:25': 'And [1]Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having completed the [a]dispensing; <I>and</I> they took along with them [b]John, who was surnamed Mark.',
'13:1': 'Now there were in [a]Antioch, in the local [1b]church, [2c]prophets and [3]teachers: [4d]Barnabas and Simeon, who was called [5]Niger, and [6]Lucius the Cyrenian, and [7]Manaen, the foster brother of [8e]Herod the tetrarch, and [9f]Saul.',
'13:2': 'And as they were [1]ministering to the Lord and fasting, the [2]Holy [a]Spirit said, [3b]Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the [c]work to which I have [d]called them.',
'13:3': 'Then, when they had [1a]fasted and prayed and [2b]laid their hands on <I>them</I>, they sent them away.',
'13:4': 'They then, having been sent out by the Holy [1]Spirit,<br class="split">[2]went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed away to [a]Cyprus.',
'13:5': 'And when they were in Salamis, they announced the [a]word of God [1]in the [2b]synagogues of the Jews. And they also had [c]John as <I>their</I> [d]attendant.',
'13:6': 'And when they had passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man, a [a]magician <I>and</I> Jewish [b]false prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus,',
'13:7': 'Who was with the [1a]proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; the latter called Barnabas and Saul to <I>him</I> and sought to hear the word of God.',
'13:8': 'But Elymas the [a]magician (for so his name is translated) [b]opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the [1]faith.',
'13:9': 'But Saul, who is also [1]Paul, [2]filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him',
'13:10': 'And said, O <I>you</I> <I>who</I> <I>are</I> full of all deceit and all unscrupulousness, son of the [a]devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the [1]straight ways of the Lord?',
'13:11': 'And now, behold, the [a]hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind, not seeing the sun for a time. And instantly a mist and a darkness fell upon him; and he went about and sought some to lead him by the hand.',
'13:12': 'Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.',
'13:13': 'And putting out to sea from Paphos, Paul and his companions came to [a]Perga of [b]Pamphylia; and [c]John [1]departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.',
'13:14': 'And they passed through from Perga and arrived at Pisidian [a]Antioch. And they went into the [b]synagogue [1]on the [c]Sabbath day and sat down.',
'13:15': 'And after the [a]reading of the [b]Law and the Prophets, the synagogue [c]rulers sent <I>word</I> to them, saying, [1]Men, brothers, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say <I>it</I>.',
'13:16': 'And Paul, rising up and motioning with his hand, said, [1]Men of Israel and [2]those who [a]fear God, listen.',
'13:17': 'The God of this people [a]Israel [b]chose our fathers and exalted the people during their sojourn in the land of [c]Egypt, and with a [1]high arm He [d]led them out of it.',
'13:18': 'And for a time of about [a]forty years [1]He carried them as a [b]nurse in the wilderness.',
'13:19': 'And when He had overthrown [a]seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land as an [b]inheritance.',
'13:20': 'And after these things, for about [1]four hundred and fifty years, He gave <I>them</I> [a]judges until [b]Samuel the prophet.',

'13:25': 'Now as John was completing his course, he said, What do you [1]suppose that I am? I am [a]not <I>the</I> <I>Christ</I>. But behold, One is coming after me, the [b]sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.',

'14:20': 'But as the disciples surrounded him, he rose up and entered into the city. And on the next day he went out with Barnabas to [a]Derbe.',
'14:21': 'And when they had [a]announced the gospel to that city and had made a considerable number of [b]disciples,<br class="split">they returned to [c]Lystra and to [d]Iconium and to [e]Antioch,',
'14:22': '[a]Establishing the [1]souls of the disciples, exhorting <I>them</I> to [2b]continue in the [3c]faith and <I>saying</I> that through many [d]tribulations we must enter into the [4e]kingdom of God.',
'14:23': 'And when they had appointed [1a]elders for them [2]in every [b]church and had prayed with [c]fastings, they [d]committed them to the Lord into whom they had believed.',

'14:27': 'And when they [1]arrived and [2]gathered the [a]church together, they [b]declared the things that God had done with them and that He had [c]opened a door of faith to the [d]Gentiles.',
'14:28': 'And they spent no little time <I>there</I> with the disciples.',
'15:1': 'And certain men [1]came down from [a]Judea and began to teach the [b]brothers, [2c]Unless you are [3d]circumcised according to the [4e]custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.',
'15:2': 'And when no little [1]dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas, <I>the</I> <I>brothers</I> directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and [a]elders in [2b]Jerusalem concerning this question.',
'15:3': 'They therefore, having been [a]sent forward by the [1b]church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail about the turning of the [c]Gentiles; and they brought great joy to all the [d]brothers.',
'15:4': 'And when they arrived in Jerusalem, they were [a]received by the [b]church and the apostles and the elders, and they [c]declared the things that God had done with them.',
'15:5': 'But certain men from the [a]sect of the [1]Pharisees who had believed rose up from among <I>them</I>, saying, It is [b]necessary to [2]circumcise them and to charge <I>them</I> to [3]keep the [c]law of Moses.',
'15:6': 'And the apostles and the elders were [1]gathered together to see about this matter.',
'15:7': 'And when much discussion had taken place, Peter rose up and said to them, [1]Men, brothers, you know that from the [2]early days God [a]chose <I>from</I> among you that through my mouth the [b]Gentiles should hear the word of the [c]gospel and believe.',
'15:8': 'And God, the Knower of [a]hearts, bore witness to them, giving <I>them</I> the Holy [b]Spirit even [c]as also to us;',
'15:9': 'And He made [a]no distinction between us and them, [b]cleansing their [1]hearts by faith.',
'15:10': 'Therefore why are you now [a]testing God by placing a [1b]yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?',
'15:11': 'But we believe that through the [1a]grace of the Lord Jesus we are [b]saved in the same way also as they are.',
'15:12': 'And all the multitude became silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul [a]relating all the [b]signs and wonders God had done among the [c]Gentiles through them.',
'15:13': 'And when they [1]finished speaking, [a]James answered, saying, [2]Men, brothers, listen to me.',
'15:14': '[1]Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles to take out from <I>them</I> a [a]people for His name.',
'15:15': 'And with this the words of the prophets agree, even as it is written,',
'15:16': '[a]&ldquo;After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the [1]tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins and erect it again,',

'15:20': 'But that we write to them to abstain from the [a]contaminations of [b]idols and [c]fornication and what is strangled and [d]blood.',
'15:21': 'For [1]Moses from ancient generations has in every city those who proclaim him in the [2]synagogues, he being [a]read every Sabbath.',
'15:22': 'It then seemed good to the apostles and the elders with the whole [a]church to choose men from among them to send to Antioch together with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, who is called [b]Barsabbas, and [c]Silas, leading men among the brothers,',

'15:24': 'Since we have heard that certain ones who went out from among us have [a]troubled you with <I>their</I> words, unsettling your souls, to whom we gave no instruction,',
'15:25': 'It seemed good to us, having become of [a]one accord, to choose men to send to you together with our [b]beloved Barnabas and Paul,',
'15:26': 'Men who have [1]risked their [2a]lives for the [b]name of our Lord Jesus Christ.',
'15:27': 'Therefore we have sent Judas and [a]Silas, who themselves will report the same things by word <I>of</I> <I>mouth</I>.',
'15:28': 'For it seemed good to the Holy [a]Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater [b]burden than these necessary things:',
'15:29': 'To abstain from things that have been sacrificed to [a]idols and blood and things strangled and fornication, from which if you carefully keep yourselves, you will do well. May you be strong.',
'15:30': 'So when they had been sent away, they went down to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they handed <I>them</I> the letter.',
'15:31': 'And when they read <I>it</I>, they rejoiced at the encouragement.',
'15:32': 'And Judas and Silas, also being [1a]prophets themselves, exhorted the brothers through much speaking and [b]confirmed <I>them</I>.',
'15:33': 'And when they had spent some time <I>there</I>, they were sent away with [a]peace from the brothers to those who had sent them.',
'15:34': '[1]But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.',
'15:35': 'And Paul and Barnabas stayed in [a]Antioch, teaching and [b]announcing the word of the Lord as the gospel with many others also.',
'15:36': 'Now after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brothers in [a]every city in which we announced the word of the Lord, <I>and</I> <I>see</I> how they are doing.',
'15:37': 'And Barnabas intended to take [a]John, who is called Mark, along with <I>them</I> also;',
'15:38': 'But Paul did not consider it suitable to take with <I>them</I> this one who [a]withdrew from them in Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work.',
'15:39': 'And there was a [1]sharp contention, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along, sailed away to [a]Cyprus.',
'15:40': 'But Paul chose [a]Silas and [1]went out, having been commended to the [b]grace of the Lord by the brothers.',
'15:41': 'And he passed through [a]Syria and Cilicia, [b]confirming the [c]churches.',
'16:1': 'And he came also to [a]Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple named [b]Timothy was there, the son of a [c]Jewish woman <I>who</I> <I>was</I> a believer, but of a Greek father;',
'16:2': 'He was well attested to by the [a]brothers in [b]Lystra and [c]Iconium.',
'16:3': 'Paul wanted this one to go forth with him; and he took <I>him</I> and [1a]circumcised him [2]because of the [b]Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.',
'16:4': 'And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the [a]decrees to keep which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.',
'16:5': 'And so the [1a]churches were strengthened in the [b]faith and [c]increased in number [d]daily.',
'16:6': 'And they passed through the region of [a]Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden [1]by the Holy [b]Spirit to speak the word in Asia.',
'16:7': 'And when they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, yet the [1a]Spirit of Jesus did [2]not allow them.',
'16:8': 'And bypassing Mysia, they came down to [a]Troas.',
'16:9': 'And a [1a]vision appeared to Paul during the night: A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, Come over into [2b]Macedonia and help us.',
'16:10': 'And when he had seen the vision, [1]we immediately [2]endeavored to go forth into Macedonia, [3]concluding that God had called us to announce the gospel to them.',
'16:11': 'And putting out to sea from [1]Troas, we ran a straight course to [2]Samothrace, and on the following day to [3]Neapolis,',
'16:12': 'And from there to [a]Philippi, which is the leading city of that part of Macedonia, a <I>Roman</I> [1]colony; and we spent some days in this city.',
'16:13': 'And on the [1a]Sabbath day we went outside the gate by the [b]river, where we supposed there would be a place of [2]prayer; and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.',
'16:14': 'And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple-dyed goods from the city of [a]Thyatira who [b]worshipped God, was listening, whose heart the [1]Lord [c]opened to give heed to the things being spoken by Paul.',
'16:15': 'And when she was [1]baptized, as well as her [a]household, she entreated <I>us</I>, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, [2]come into my [3]house and abide. And she constrained us.',
'16:16': 'And as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave girl having a [1a]spirit of [2]Python met us, who brought her masters much profit by [3b]divining.',
'16:17': 'This woman followed after Paul and us and [a]cried out, saying, These men are [b]slaves of the [c]Most High God, who announce to you a way of salvation.',
'16:18': 'And she did this for many days. But Paul was greatly disturbed; and turning, he said to the spirit, I charge you in the [a]name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it [b]came out that very hour.',
'16:19': 'But when her masters saw that their hope of [a]profit had gone out, they laid hold of Paul and [b]Silas and [c]dragged <I>them</I> into the marketplace before the rulers.',
'16:20': 'And when they had brought them to the [1a]magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, are [b]throwing our city into confusion,',
'16:21': 'And they are announcing [a]customs which are not lawful for us, being [b]Romans, to accept or do.',
'16:22': 'And the crowd rose up together against them, and the magistrates tore off their garments and ordered <I>some</I> to [a]beat <I>them</I> with rods.',
'16:23': 'And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they threw <I>them</I> into [a]prison, charging the jailer to keep them securely,',
'16:24': 'Who, having received such a charge, threw them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the [1a]stocks.',
'16:25': 'And about [a]midnight Paul and Silas, while praying, sang hymns of praise to God; and the prisoners were listening to them.',
'16:26': 'And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were [a]shaken. And instantly all the doors were [b]opened and everyone&rsquo;s [c]bonds were unfastened.',
'16:27': 'And the jailer, waking up out of his sleep and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword and was about to [a]do away with himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.',
'16:28': 'But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do no harm to yourself, for we are all here.',
'16:29': 'And <I>the</I> <I>jailer</I> asked for lights and rushed in; and trembling, he [a]fell down before Paul and Silas.',
'16:30': 'And leading them outside, he said, Sirs, [a]what must I do to be saved?',
'16:31': 'And they said, [a]Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be [b]saved, you and your [1]household.',
'16:32': 'And they spoke the word of God to him together with all those in his house.',
'16:33': 'And he took them with <I>him</I> in that <I>very</I> hour of the night and washed their wounds. And he was [1a]baptized immediately, he and all his <I>household</I>.',
'16:34': 'And he brought them [1]up [2]into his house and [a]set a table before <I>them</I>; and he [b]exulted because he had believed in God with all his household.',
'16:35': 'Now when day came, the magistrates sent the [1]lictors, saying, Release those men.',
'16:36': 'And the jailer reported these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent that you may be released. Now therefore come out and go in peace.',
'16:37': 'But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are [a]Romans, and have thrown <I>us</I> into prison; and now secretly they are thrusting us out? No indeed! But let them come themselves and bring us out.',
'16:38': 'And the lictors reported these words to the magistrates. And they became [a]frightened when they heard that they were Romans.',
'16:39': 'And they came and entreated them. And when they had brought <I>them</I> out, they asked <I>them</I> to [a]depart from the city.',
'16:40': 'And they went out from the prison and entered the [a]<I>house</I> of Lydia; and when they saw the [b]brothers, they exhorted <I>them</I> and went forth.',
'17:1': 'And they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to [1a]Thessalonica, where there was a [2b]synagogue of the Jews.',
'17:2': 'And according to his [a]custom Paul [1]went in to them, and on three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the [b]Scriptures,',
'17:3': 'Opening and setting before <I>them</I> that the Christ had to [a]suffer and [b]rise from the dead, and <I>saying</I>, This is the [c]Christ, the Jesus whom I announce to you.',
'17:4': 'And [a]some of them were persuaded and [1]were joined to Paul and [b]Silas, as well as a great multitude of the [c]devout [d]Greeks, and of the chief [e]women not a few.',
'17:5': 'But the Jews, becoming [a]jealous and taking along some evil men from among the loafers in the marketplace, gathered a crowd and [b]set the city in an uproar; and coming upon the house of [c]Jason, they sought to bring them to the populace.',
'17:6': 'But when they did not find them, they [a]dragged Jason and some brothers before the city officials, shouting, These men who have [b]upset the [1]world have come here also,',
'17:7': 'Whom Jason has welcomed; and these all act contrary to the decrees of [a]Caesar, saying that there is another [b]king, Jesus.',
'17:8': 'And they stirred up the crowd and the city officials, who listened to these things.',
'17:9': 'And when they had taken bail from Jason and the rest, they released them.',
'17:10': 'And the [a]brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away during the night to Berea, who, when they arrived, went off into the [b]synagogue of the Jews.',
'17:11': 'Now these people were more [1]noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, [a]examining the Scriptures daily <I>to</I> <I>see</I> whether these things were so.',
'17:12': 'Therefore many of them believed, and <I>there</I> <I>were</I> not a few Greek [a]women of high standing and men.',
'17:13': 'But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been announced by Paul in Berea also, they came there as well, [a]agitating and stirring up the crowds.',
'17:14': 'And immediately the [a]brothers then sent Paul off, to [b]go as far as the sea; and Silas and [c]Timothy remained there.',
'17:15': 'And those who conducted Paul brought <I>him</I> as far as [1a]Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and [b]Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they went off.',
'17:16': 'And while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, [a]his [1]spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was [2b]full of idols.',
'17:17': 'He reasoned therefore in the [a]synagogue with the Jews and the [b]devout, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be <I>there</I>.',
'17:18': 'And some of the [1]Epicurean and [2]Stoic philosophers also confronted him. And some said, What would this [3]babbler wish to say? And others, He seems to be an announcer of foreign [4]deities&mdash;because he was [a]announcing Jesus and the [b]resurrection as the gospel.',
'17:19': 'And they took hold of him and led <I>him</I> to the [1a]Areopagus, saying, May we know what this [b]new teaching is which is being spoken by you?',
'17:20': 'For you are bringing [a]strange things to our ears. We intend to know therefore [1]what these things mean.',
'17:21': '(Now all the Athenians and the foreigners sojourning <I>there</I> spent their time on nothing other than telling or hearing something new.)',
'17:22': 'And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, [1]Men of Athens, I observe that in every way you [2]very much revere your deities.',
'17:23': 'For while I was passing through and carefully observing the objects of your [a]worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. What therefore you worship [b]without knowing, this I announce to you.',
'17:24': 'The [1]God who [a]made the world and all things in it, this One, being [b]Lord of heaven and earth, does [c]not dwell in temples made with hands;',
'17:25': 'Neither is He served by human hands as though He needed anything in addition, since He Himself gives to all life and [a]breath and all things.',
'17:26': 'And He made from [1]one [a]every nation of men to dwell on all the [b]face of the earth, determining beforehand <I>their</I> [2]appointed seasons and the [c]boundaries of their dwelling,',
'17:27': 'That they might [a]seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find <I>Him</I>, even though He is [1b]not far from each one of us;',
'17:28': 'For [1]in Him we live and move and are, as even some [2]poets among you have said, For we are also [3]His [4]race.',
'17:29': 'Being then the race of God, we ought not to suppose that [1]what is divine is like [a]gold or silver or stone, <I>like</I> an engraving of art and [2]thought of man.',
'17:30': 'Therefore, having overlooked the [a]times of [b]ignorance, God now [1]charges all men everywhere to [c]repent,',
'17:31': 'Because He has set a [1a]day in which He is to [b]judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated, having furnished [2]proof to all by [c]raising Him from the dead.',
'17:32': 'And when they heard of a [a]resurrection of the dead, some [b]scoffed; and others said, We will hear you yet [c]again concerning this.',
'17:33': 'Thus Paul went out from their midst.',
'17:34': 'But some men [a]joined him and believed, among whom also was Dionysius the [b]Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.',
'18:1': 'After these things he departed from [a]Athens and came to [b]Corinth.',
'18:2': 'And having found a certain Jew named [a]Aquila, a native of [b]Pontus, recently come from [c]Italy, and Priscilla his wife (because [1d]Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from [e]Rome), he went to them.',
'18:3': 'And because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and [a]worked; for they were tentmakers by trade.',
'18:4': 'And he reasoned [1]in the [2a]synagogue every [3]Sabbath, persuading Jews and [4b]Greeks.',
'18:5': 'And [1]when both Silas and [a]Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was [2]constrained by the word, solemnly [b]testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the [c]Christ.',
'18:6': 'But when they resisted and [a]blasphemed, he [b]shook out his garments and said to them, Your [c]blood be upon your head; I am clean. From now on I will [1]go to the [d]Gentiles.',
'18:7': 'And he left there and went into the house of one named Titius Justus, one who [a]worshipped God, whose house was next to the synagogue.',
'18:8': 'And [a]Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord with his whole [1b]household; and many of the Corinthians, when they heard, believed and were baptized.',
'18:9': 'And the Lord said to Paul in the [a]night by a [1]vision, Do [b]not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent;',
'18:10': 'Because I Myself am [a]with you, and no one will assail you to harm you, because I have many [b]people in this city.',
'18:11': 'And he [1]remained <I>there</I> a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.',
'18:12': 'But while Gallio was [a]proconsul of Achaia, the [b]Jews rose up against Paul with one accord and [c]brought him to the judgment seat,',
'18:13': 'Saying, This man incites men to worship God contrary to the law.',
'18:14': 'But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or some wicked crime, O Jews, I would for that reason tolerate you;',
'18:15': 'But if there are [a]questions concerning words and names and your own [b]law, look <I>after</I> <I>it</I> yourselves. A judge of these things I do not intend to be.',
'18:16': 'And he drove them away from the judgment seat.',
'18:17': 'And they all laid hold of [1]Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat <I>him</I> in front of the judgment seat. And Gallio was not concerned about any of these things.',
'18:18': 'And Paul, having remained <I>there</I> yet a considerable number of days, took leave of the brothers and sailed away to Syria, and with him Priscilla and [a]Aquila, having [b]shorn his head in [c]Cenchrea, for he had a [1]vow.',
'18:19': 'And they arrived at [a]Ephesus, and he left them there; but he [1]entered into the [b]synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.',
'18:20': 'And when they asked <I>him</I> to remain for a longer time, he did not consent;',
'18:21': 'But taking leave of <I>them</I> and saying, I will come back to you again, God [a]willing,<br class="split">he put out to sea from Ephesus.',
'18:22': 'And coming down to Caesarea, he went up <I>to</I> <I>Jerusalem</I> and greeted the [a]church and [1]went down to [b]Antioch.',
'18:23': 'And when he had spent some time <I>there</I>, he [1]went off, passing through the country of [a]Galatia and Phrygia in order, [b]confirming all the disciples.',
'18:24': 'And a certain Jew named [a]Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, arrived at Ephesus, <I>and</I> he was powerful in the Scriptures.',
'18:25': 'This man was instructed in the [1]way of the Lord, and being [a]fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew [2]only the [b]baptism of John.',
'18:26': 'And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And when Priscilla and [a]Aquila heard him, they took him to <I>themselves</I> and expounded the [b]way of God to him more accurately.',

'18:28': 'For he vigorously confuted the Jews publicly, showing by the [a]Scriptures that Jesus was the [b]Christ.',
'19:1': 'Now while [a]Apollos was in Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came down to [b]Ephesus and found some disciples,',
'19:2': 'And he said to them, Did you [1]receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they <I>said</I> to him, On the contrary, we did [2a]not even hear whether there is a Holy Spirit.',
'19:3': 'And he said, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into [1a]John&rsquo;s baptism.',

'19:17': 'And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, dwelling in Ephesus; and [a]fear fell upon them all, and the [b]name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.',
'19:18': 'And many of those who had believed came, [1a]confessing and making known their [2]practices.',
'19:19': 'And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and [1]burned <I>them</I> before all; and they counted up the price of them and found <I>it</I> <I>to</I> <I>be</I> fifty thousand [2]pieces of silver.',
'19:20': '[1]Thus, the word of the Lord [a]grew mightily and prevailed.',
'19:21': 'And when these things were fulfilled, Paul [1a]purposed in his [2]spirit to pass through [b]Macedonia and Achaia and [3]go to [c]Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also [4d]see Rome.',
'19:22': 'And having sent into Macedonia two of those who [a]served him, [b]Timothy and [1]Erastus, he himself [2]stayed in Asia for a time.',
'19:23': 'And about that time no small [a]disturbance took place concerning the [1b]Way.',
'19:24': 'For a certain man named [1]Demetrius, a silversmith who [2]made silver shrines of [3]Artemis, afforded no little business to the craftsmen.',
'19:25': 'These he [1]assembled together with the workmen of similar trades as well and said, [2]Men, you know that from this business we have <I>our</I> [a]prosperity.',
'19:26': 'And you observe and hear that not only at Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and perverted a considerable number, saying that the gods being made by [a]hands are no gods <I>at</I> <I>all</I>.',
'19:27': 'And not only is there danger that our trade will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the [a]great goddess Artemis will be counted as nothing and that the magnificence of her whom the whole of Asia and the inhabited earth worships will also be overthrown.',
'19:28': 'And when they heard <I>this</I>, they became full of rage and began to cry out, saying, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!',
'19:29': 'And the city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theater, seizing [1]Gaius and [a]Aristarchus of Macedonia, Paul&rsquo;s traveling [b]companions.',
'19:30': 'And when Paul intended to enter into the populace, the disciples would not allow him.',
'19:31': 'And some of the [1]Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and entreated <I>him</I> not to venture into the theater himself.',
'19:32': 'So then some were [a]crying out one thing, and some another; for the assembly was in confusion, and the majority did not know for what cause they had come together.',
'19:33': 'And they drew [1]Alexander out of the crowd, the Jews having pushed him forward; and Alexander, [a]motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the populace.',
'19:34': 'But when they realized that he was a Jew, one voice arose from all for about two hours, crying out, [a]Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!',
'19:35': 'And the town clerk, having quieted the crowd, said, [1]Men of Ephesus, which of <I>you</I> men is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great Artemis and of the <I>image</I> [2]fallen from [a]Zeus?',
'19:36': 'Since these things therefore cannot be disputed, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash;',
'19:37': 'For you have brought forth these men <I>who</I> <I>are</I> neither temple [a]robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess.',
'19:38': 'If then Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a matter against anyone, courts are being conducted and there are [a]proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another.',
'19:39': 'But if you seek after anything further, it shall be settled in the [1]legal assembly.',
'19:40': 'For indeed we are in danger of being charged with [a]insurrection for today&rsquo;s affair, since there is no reason <I>for</I> <I>it</I>; <I>and</I> with reference to it we will not be able to give an account concerning this disorderly gathering.',
'19:41': 'And when he had said these things, he [1]dismissed the assembly.',
'20:1': 'And after the uproar had ceased, Paul, having sent for the disciples and having exhorted <I>them</I>, took leave <I>of</I> <I>them</I> and went off to go into [1a]Macedonia.',
'20:2': 'And when he had passed through those parts and had exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece,',
'20:3': 'And spent [1]three months <I>there</I>. <I>And</I> when a [a]plot was made against him by the [b]Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he [2]resolved to return through Macedonia.',
'20:4': 'And Sopater of Berea, <I>the</I> <I>son</I> of Pyrrhus, accompanied him, as well as [a]Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians and [1]Gaius of [b]Derbe and [c]Timothy and the Asians, [d]Tychicus and [e]Trophimus.',
'20:5': 'These had gone on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas.',
'20:6': 'And we sailed away from [a]Philippi after the days of [b]Unleavened Bread and in five days came to them in [c]Troas, where we spent seven days.',
'20:7': 'And on the [1a]first day of the week, when [2]we gathered together to [b]break bread, Paul conversed with them since he was to go forth on the next day; and he extended his message until midnight.',
'20:8': 'And there were a considerable number of lamps in the [a]upper room where we were gathered together.',
'20:9': 'And a certain young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window and began to sink into deep sleep while Paul conversed longer; <I>and</I> when he had been overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.',
'20:10': 'But Paul went down and fell [a]upon him, and embracing <I>him</I>, he said, Do not make a commotion, for his soul is in him.',
'20:11': 'And when he had gone up and [a]broken the bread and [1]eaten and had spoken for a considerable time, until daybreak, he therefore went forth.',
'20:12': 'And they brought the boy alive and were comforted, <I>and</I> <I>that</I> not moderately.',
'20:13': 'But we, going ahead onto the ship, set sail for Assos, from there intending to pick up Paul, for so he had arranged <I>it</I>, himself intending to go by foot.',
'20:14': 'And when he met us in Assos, we picked him up and came to Mitylene.',
'20:15': 'And sailing away from there, on the following day we arrived opposite Chios; and on the next day we put in at Samos. And on the day following we came to Miletus,',
'20:16': 'For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so that he might not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying <I>so</I> <I>that</I> if possible he might be in [a]Jerusalem on the [1]day of [b]Pentecost.',
'20:17': 'And from Miletus he sent <I>word</I> to Ephesus and called for the [a]elders of the [b]church.',
'20:18': 'And when they came to him, he said to them, You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in [a]Asia, [b]how I was with you all the time,',
'20:19': '[a]Serving the Lord as a slave with all [b]humility and [c]tears and [d]trials which came upon me by the [e]plots of the Jews;',
'20:20': 'How I did not [a]withhold any of those things that are profitable by not declaring <I>them</I> to you and by <I>not</I> teaching you publicly and from [b]house to house,',
'20:21': 'Solemnly [a]testifying both to Jews and to [b]Greeks [c]repentance unto God and [d]faith [1]in our Lord Jesus[2].',
'20:22': 'And now, behold, I am going [1]bound in the [2]spirit to [a]Jerusalem, not knowing what will meet me [3]there,',
'20:23': '[1]Except that the Holy [a]Spirit solemnly testifies to me in city after city, saying that [b]bonds and [c]afflictions await me.',
'20:24': 'But I [1]consider my [2a]life of no account <I>as</I> <I>if</I> precious to myself, in order that I may finish my [b]course and the [c]ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly [d]testify of the [e]gospel of the [f]grace of God.',
'20:25': 'And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the [1a]kingdom, will see my [b]face [2]no more.',
'20:26': 'Therefore I testify to you [1]on [a]this day that [2]I am clean from the [b]blood of all men,',
'20:27': 'For I did not [a]shrink from declaring to you all the [b]counsel of God.',
'20:28': '[a]Take heed to yourselves and to all the [1b]flock, among whom the Holy [2c]Spirit has [d]placed you as [3e]overseers to [4f]shepherd the [g]church of God, which He [h]obtained through [5]His own [i]blood.',
'20:29': 'I know that after my departure fierce [a]wolves will come in among you, not [1]sparing the flock.',
'20:30': 'And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to [1a]draw away the disciples after them.',
'20:31': 'Therefore [a]watch, remembering that for [b]three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with [c]tears.',
'20:32': 'And now I [a]commit you to [1]God and to the word of His [2b]grace, which is able to [c]build <I>you</I> up and to give <I>you</I> the [3d]inheritance among all those who have been [4e]sanctified.',
'20:33': 'I have [a]coveted no one&rsquo;s silver or gold or clothing.',
'20:34': 'You yourselves know that these [1a]hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me.',
'20:35': 'In all things I have shown you by example that [a]toiling in this way we ought to support [1]the [b]weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, [2]It is more blessed to [c]give than to receive.',
'20:36': 'And when he had said these things, he [a]knelt down with them all and prayed.',
'20:37': 'And there was considerable weeping by all; and [a]falling on Paul&rsquo;s neck, they kissed him affectionately,',
'20:38': 'Especially pained over the word which he had spoken, that they would no longer behold his [a]face. And they [b]escorted him to the ship.',
'21:1': 'And when we parted from them and set sail, we took a straight course and came to Cos, and on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.',
'21:2': 'And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we went on board and set sail.',
'21:3': 'And when we sighted [a]Cyprus and left it on the left, we sailed to [b]Syria and came down to Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its cargo.',
'21:4': 'And when we had sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days. These [1]told Paul through the [a]Spirit [b]not to set foot in [c]Jerusalem.',
'21:5': 'And when we completed the days, we went forth and went on our way, with all <I>of</I> <I>them</I>, including the women and children, [a]escorting us until <I>we</I> <I>were</I> outside the city. And when we had [b]knelt down on the beach and prayed,',
'21:6': 'We took leave of one another and went on board the ship; and they returned home.',
'21:7': 'And when we finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais; and we greeted the [a]brothers and remained with them one day.',
'21:8': 'And on the next day we went forth and came to [a]Caesarea; and entering into the [1]house of [b]Philip the [c]evangelist, who was <I>one</I> of the [d]seven, we remained with him.',
'21:9': 'Now this man had four virgin daughters who [a]prophesied.',
'21:10': 'And while we remained <I>there</I> many days, a certain prophet named [a]Agabus came down from Judea.',
'21:11': 'And he came to us and took Paul&rsquo;s [a]belt; and having bound his own feet and hands, he said, Thus [1]says the Holy Spirit, In this way will the Jews in Jerusalem [b]bind the man whose belt this is and [c]deliver <I>him</I> into the hands of the Gentiles.',
'21:12': 'And when we heard these things, both [1]we and those in that place entreated him [a]not to [b]go up to Jerusalem.',
'21:13': 'Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to [a]die in Jerusalem for the [b]name of the Lord Jesus.',
'21:14': 'And since he would not be persuaded, we became silent, saying, The [a]will of the Lord be done.',
'21:15': 'And after these days we gathered our baggage and went up to [a]Jerusalem.',
'21:16': 'And <I>some</I> of the disciples from [a]Caesarea also went with us, bringing <I>us</I> to a certain Mnason of [b]Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to [1]lodge.',
'21:17': 'And when we had [1]come to [a]Jerusalem, the [b]brothers [c]welcomed us gladly.',
'21:18': 'And on the following day Paul went in with us to [1a]James, and all the [b]elders were present.',
'21:19': 'And having greeted them, he [a]related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his [b]ministry.',
'21:20': 'And when they heard <I>it</I>, they [a]glorified God and said to him, You observe, brother, how many [1]thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are [2b]zealous for the [c]law.',
'21:21': 'And they have been informed concerning you that you are [a]teaching all the Jews throughout the nations [1]apostasy from Moses, telling them [b]not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the [c]customs.',
'21:22': 'What then is <I>to</I> <I>be</I> <I>done</I>? [1]They will certainly hear that you have come.',
'21:23': 'Therefore do this that we tell you: We have four men who have a [1]vow on themselves;',
'21:24': 'Take these and be [1a]purified with them, and pay their [2]expenses that they may [3]shave their heads. And all will know that there is nothing to the things that they have been informed of concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the [b]law.',
'21:25': 'But concerning the Gentiles who have believed, we have <I>already</I> written, having decided that they should keep themselves from [a]idol sacrifices and blood and anything strangled and fornication.',
'21:26': 'Then Paul took the men <I>and</I> on the following day, [1]being purified with them, entered into the temple, giving notice of the [2]completion of the days of the purification, until the [a]offering was offered for each one of them.',
'21:27': 'And when the seven days were about to be concluded, the [a]Jews from [b]Asia saw him in the temple and [c]threw all the crowd into confusion; and they [d]laid their hands on him,',
'21:28': 'Crying out, [1]Men of Israel, help! This is the man who [a]teaches all men everywhere [b]against the [2]people and the law and [3]this place; and further, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and has [4c]profaned this [5]holy place.',
'21:29': 'For they had previously seen [a]Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed Paul had brought into the temple.',
'21:30': 'And the whole city was stirred, and the people ran together; and they [a]laid hold of Paul and [b]dragged him [c]outside the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.',
'21:31': 'And as they were seeking to [a]kill him, a report came up to the [1b]commander of the [2]cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.',
'21:32': 'And he at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.',
'21:33': 'Then the commander drew near and laid hold of him and ordered <I>him</I> to be [a]bound with two [b]chains. And he inquired who he might be and what he had done.',
'21:34': 'And some among the crowd were [a]shouting one thing, and some another. And since he could not find out the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the [b]barracks.',
'21:35': 'And when Paul came to the stairs, it so happened that he was being carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;',
'21:36': 'For the multitude of the people were following and crying out, [a]Away with him!',
'21:37': 'And when he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the commander, Am I allowed to say anything to you? And he said, You know Greek?',
'21:38': 'You are not then the Egyptian who some days ago revolted and led out the four thousand men of the Assassins into the wilderness?',
'21:39': 'But Paul said, I am a [a]Jewish man of [b]Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city, and I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.',
'21:40': 'And when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and [a]motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed <I>them</I> in the [b]Hebrew [1]dialect, saying,',
'22:1': '[1]Men, [a]brothers and fathers, hear my [2b]defense <I>which</I> I now <I>make</I> to you.',
'22:2': 'And when they heard that he addressed them in the Hebrew [1]dialect, they became more quiet. And he said,',
'22:3': 'I am [1]a [a]Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia but brought up in this city and trained at the feet of [b]Gamaliel, according to the [c]strictness of the law of our fathers, being [d]zealous [e]for God, even as you all are today.',
'22:4': 'And I [a]persecuted this [1]Way unto death, binding and delivering to [b]prisons both men and women,',
'22:5': 'As also the [a]high priest and all the [1]assembly of the elders testify for me; from whom I also received [b]letters to the brothers and went to [c]Damascus to bring those also who were there bound to Jerusalem that they might be punished.',
'22:6': 'And as I journeyed and [a]drew near to Damascus about midday, suddenly a great light flashed out of heaven around me;',
'22:7': 'And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting [1]Me?',
'22:8': 'And I answered, Who are You, [1]Lord? And He said to me, I am Jesus the [a]Nazarene, whom you persecute.',
'22:9': 'And those who were with me beheld the light, but did not [1]hear the voice of the One who was speaking to me.',
'22:10': 'And I said, [a]What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise up and go into Damascus, and there it [1]will be told to you concerning all the things which have been appointed to you to do.',
'22:11': 'And as I could [1]not see because of the glory of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me and came into Damascus.',
'22:12': 'And a certain [1a]Ananias, a devout man according to the law, [b]well attested to by all the Jews dwelling <I>there</I>,',
'22:13': 'Came to me, and standing by, said to me, Saul, brother, [1a]receive your sight! And in that very hour I looked up at him.',
'22:14': 'And he said, The [a]God of our fathers has previously [b]appointed you to know His [c]will and to see the [d]righteous One and to hear the voice from His mouth;',
'22:15': 'For you will be a [a]witness to Him unto all men of the things which you have [b]seen and heard.',
'22:16': 'And now, why do you delay? Rise up and [1]be [a]baptized and wash away your sins, [2b]calling on [3]His [c]name.',
'22:17': 'And when I returned to [a]Jerusalem and was praying in the [b]temple, I went into a [1]trance;',
'22:18': 'And I saw Him saying to me, Hurry, and go quickly out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept your [a]testimony concerning Me.',
'22:19': 'And I said, Lord, they know that I was [a]imprisoning and beating from [b]synagogue to synagogue those who believe on You;',
'22:20': 'And when the [a]blood of Your [b]witness Stephen was being [c]shed, I myself also was standing by and [d]approving and keeping the garments of those who did away with him.',
'22:21': 'And He said to me, Go, for I will send you forth [a]far away to the [b]Gentiles.',
'22:22': 'And they listened to him up to this word, and <I>then</I> they lifted up their voice, saying, [a]Away from the earth with such a man, for it is [b]not fitting for him to live!',
'22:23': 'And as they were crying out and casting off their garments and throwing dust in the air,',
'22:24': 'The [1]commander ordered him to be brought into the [a]barracks, saying that he should be [b]examined by scourging in order that he might [c]ascertain for what cause they were shouting against him so.',
'22:25': 'But as they stretched him out [1]with the thongs, Paul [2]said to the centurion standing by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man <I>who</I> <I>is</I> a [a]Roman and uncondemned?',
'22:26': 'And when the centurion heard <I>this</I>, he went to the commander and reported, saying, What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman.',
'22:27': 'And the commander came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.',
'22:28': 'And the commander answered, With a large sum of money I acquired this citizenship. And Paul said, But I was even born <I>a</I> <I>Roman</I>.',
'22:29': 'Immediately therefore those who were about to [a]examine him withdrew from him; and the [b]commander also was [c]afraid, realizing that he was a [d]Roman and that he had [e]bound him.',
'22:30': 'And on the next day he, intending to find out for certain why he was accused by the Jews, released him and ordered the chief priests and all the [1a]Sanhedrin to come together; and having brought Paul down, he had <I>him</I> stand before them.',
'23:1': 'And Paul, looking intently at the [1a]Sanhedrin, said, [2]Men, brothers, I have conducted myself in all good [3b]conscience before God until this day.',
'23:2': 'And the high priest [a]Ananias commanded those who stood by him to [b]strike him on the mouth.',
'23:3': 'Then Paul [1]said to him, God is going to strike you, you [a]whitewashed [b]wall. And do you sit to [2c]judge me according to the law, and contrary to the law you order me to be struck?',
'23:4': 'And those standing by said, Do you revile the [a]high priest of God?',
'23:5': 'And Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, [a]&ldquo;You shall not [b]speak evilly of the ruler of your people.&rdquo;',
'23:6': 'And Paul, knowing that one part was [1a]Sadducees and the other [2]Pharisees, [3]cried out in the [b]Sanhedrin, [4]Men, brothers, I am a [c]Pharisee, a son of Pharisees; concerning the [d]hope and [e]resurrection of the dead I am being [5]judged!',
'23:7': 'And when he spoke this, a dissension took place between the Pharisees and Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.',
'23:8': 'For the Sadducees say that there is [a]no resurrection, neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.',
'23:9': 'And there was a great outcry; and some of the [a]scribes of the Pharisees&rsquo; party rose up and contended, saying, We find [b]nothing evil in this man. And what if a spirit has spoken to him, or an [c]angel?',
'23:10': 'And when much [a]dissension had taken place, the [1]commander, fearing that Paul might be torn to pieces by them, [2]ordered the detachment of soldiers to go down and seize him from their midst and bring <I>him</I> into the [b]barracks.',
'23:11': 'But in the [a]night [1]following, the Lord [2b]stood by him and said, Take [c]courage, for as you have [3]solemnly [d]testified to the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so also you must [4]testify in [5]Rome.',
'23:12': 'And when it became day, the [a]Jews formed a [1b]plot and [2]put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had [c]killed Paul.',
'23:13': 'And there were more than forty who swore to this conspiracy.',
'23:14': 'They came to the chief priests and the elders and said, [1]We have bound ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.',
'23:15': 'Now therefore you, with the Sanhedrin, notify the commander to bring him down to you, as though you were going to [1]determine more accurately the things concerning him; and we, before he draws near, are ready to [a]do away with him.',
'23:16': 'But the son of Paul&rsquo;s sister [1]heard of the [a]ambush, and he came and entered into the [b]barracks and reported <I>it</I> to Paul.',
'23:17': 'And Paul called one of the centurions to <I>him</I> and said, Bring this young man to the [a]commander, for he has something to report to him.',
'23:18': 'So he took him and brought <I>him</I> to the commander and said, The [a]prisoner Paul called me to <I>him</I> and asked <I>me</I> to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you.',
'23:19': 'And the commander took him by the hand and, withdrawing privately, inquired, What is it that you have to report to me?',
'23:20': 'And he said, The Jews have [a]agreed to ask you to bring Paul down tomorrow to the [b]Sanhedrin, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more accurately concerning him.',
'23:21': 'So you should not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him; they have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they have [a]done away with him. And now they are ready, awaiting the promise from you.',
'23:22': 'So the commander dismissed the young man, charging <I>him</I>, Do not tell anyone that you have informed me of these things.',
'23:23': 'And he called to <I>him</I> a certain two of the centurions and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea, as well as seventy horsemen and two hundred [1]spearmen, by the [2]third hour of the night;',
'23:24': 'And <I>they</I> <I>were</I> <I>also</I> <I>to</I> provide mounts to put Paul on and bring <I>him</I> safely to [1a]Felix the [b]governor.',
'23:25': 'And he wrote a letter having this form:',
'23:26': 'Claudius Lysias, to his [a]Excellency, Governor Felix, [b]rejoice.',
'23:27': 'This man, having been [a]seized by the Jews and about to be [b]done away with by them, I came upon with my detachment of soldiers and rescued, when I learned that he was a [c]Roman.',
'23:28': 'And intending to [a]ascertain the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought <I>him</I> down to their Sanhedrin,',
'23:29': '<I>And</I> found him to be accused concerning [a]questions of their [b]law, but having nothing [c]worthy of death or of bonds laid to his charge.',
'23:30': 'And when it was [a]disclosed to me that there was a [b]plot against the man, I sent <I>him</I> at once to you, charging the [c]accusers also to speak the things against him before you.',
'23:31': 'So the soldiers, according to what they had been directed, took up Paul and brought <I>him</I> by night to [1]Antipatris.',
'23:32': 'And on the next day, leaving the horsemen to depart with him, they returned to the [a]barracks.',
'23:33': 'And when they entered into [a]Caesarea and handed over the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also to him.',
'23:34': 'And when he had read <I>it</I>, he asked from what province he was; and learning that <I>he</I> <I>was</I> from [a]Cilicia,',
'23:35': 'He said, I will hear your case fully when your [a]accusers also arrive. And he ordered him to be guarded in Herod&rsquo;s [1b]praetorium.',
'24:1': 'And after five days the high priest [a]Ananias came down with some elders and a certain [1]orator, Tertullus; and they gave their information against Paul to the [b]governor.',
'24:2': 'And when <I>Paul</I> was called, Tertullus began to accuse <I>him</I>, saying, [1]Since we have obtained much peace through you, and since reforms are being carried out for this nation through your forethought',
'24:3': 'Both in every way and everywhere, we welcome <I>it</I>, most [a]excellent [b]Felix, with all thankfulness.',
'24:4': 'But that I may not detain you further, I entreat you to hear us briefly in your forbearance.',
'24:5': 'For we have found this man a pest and an [a]agitator of [b]insurrections among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth and a ringleader of the [c]sect of the [d]Nazarenes,',
'24:6': 'Who has also tried to [a]profane the temple. Him also we laid hold of [1]and wanted to judge according to our law,',
'24:7': 'But Lysias the commander came by and with much force took <I>him</I> away from our hands',
'24:8': 'And ordered his accusers to come to you. When you have examined <I>this</I> <I>man</I> yourself concerning all these things, you will be able to [a]ascertain from him the things which we accuse him of.',
'24:9': 'And the Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these things were so.',
'24:10': 'And when the governor nodded for him to speak, Paul answered: Knowing that for many years you have been a judge to this nation, I gladly make my [1a]defense for the things concerning myself,',
'24:11': 'Since you can realize that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to [a]worship in [b]Jerusalem.',
'24:12': 'And [a]neither in the [b]temple did they find me disputing with anyone nor stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor throughout the city.',
'24:13': '[a]Neither are they able to prove to you the things which they now accuse me of.',
'24:14': 'But I confess this to you, that according to the [1a]Way, which they call a [b]sect, so I [2c]serve the [d]God of our fathers, believing all the things that are written in the [e]Law and in the Prophets;',
'24:15': 'Having [a]hope toward God, which these themselves also look for, that there is to be a [1]resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous.',
'24:16': 'Because of this I also [a]exercise myself to always have a [1b]conscience without offense toward God and men.',
'24:17': 'Now after [a]many years I came bringing [b]alms to my [c]nation and offerings;',
'24:18': 'In which they found me [1]purified in the temple, with no crowd or uproar. But certain Jews from [a]Asia,',
'24:19': 'Who should have been present before you and made [a]accusation if they had anything against me&mdash;',
'24:20': 'Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the [a]Sanhedrin,',
'24:21': '<I>Other</I> than concerning this one sound which I cried out while standing among them, Concerning the [a]resurrection of the dead I am being judged today before you.',
'24:22': 'But Felix, knowing more accurately the things concerning the [a]Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the [b]commander comes down, I will determine your affairs.',
'24:23': 'And he directed the centurion to [a]keep him <I>in</I> <I>custody</I>, and that he should have some [b]liberty and that no one should prevent his own people from attending to him.',
'24:24': 'But after some days, Felix arrived with [1]Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, and he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the [a]faith in Christ Jesus.',
'24:25': 'And as he was [1]reasoning concerning [2a]righteousness and [b]self-control and the [c]judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I [d]will call for you;',
'24:26': 'Hoping at the same time also that [1a]money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore he also sent for him more frequently and conversed with him.',
'24:27': 'And when [1]two years were completed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius [2a]Festus; and wanting to [3]gain [b]favor with the Jews, Felix [c]left Paul [d]bound.',
'25:1': '[a]Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from [b]Caesarea.',
'25:2': 'And the [a]chief priests and leading men of the Jews gave their information to him against Paul; and they entreated him,',
'25:3': 'Asking for a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, <I>they</I> <I>themselves</I> setting an [a]ambush to [b]do away with him on the way.',
'25:4': 'Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept <I>in</I> <I>custody</I> in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed <I>there</I> shortly.',
'25:5': 'Therefore, he said, let [1]influential men from among you go down with <I>me</I>, and if there is anything [2]wrong in the man, let them [a]accuse him.',
'25:6': 'And having stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day he sat on the [a]judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought.',
'25:7': 'And when he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious [a]charges against <I>him</I>, which they were [b]not able to prove,',
'25:8': 'While Paul said in his [1a]defense, [b]Neither against the [c]law of the Jews nor against the [d]temple nor against [e]Caesar have I sinned in anything.',
'25:9': 'But Festus, wanting to [1]gain [a]favor with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Are you willing to go up to [b]Jerusalem and be judged there before me concerning these things?',
'25:10': 'And Paul said, I am standing before Caesar&rsquo;s [a]judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. I have done [b]nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also very well know.',
'25:11': 'If therefore I am doing wrong and have committed anything [a]worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there is nothing to the things which these [b]accuse me of, no one can hand me over to them. I [1c]appeal to [2]Caesar.',
'25:12': 'Then when Festus had conferred with the [1]council, he answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go.',
'25:13': 'Now when some days had passed, [1a]Agrippa the king and [2]Bernice arrived at [b]Caesarea and greeted Festus.',
'25:14': 'And while they were staying some additional days there, Festus laid before the king the matters regarding Paul, saying, There is a certain man who has been [a]left a [b]prisoner by [c]Felix,',
'25:15': 'Concerning whom, when I was in Jerusalem, the [a]chief priests and the elders of the Jews gave information and asked for a sentence against him.',
'25:16': 'To them I answered that it is not the [a]custom with Romans to hand over any man before he who is [b]accused meets the [c]accusers face to face and has an opportunity for a [d]defense concerning the charge.',
'25:17': 'So when they had come together here, I made no delay; on the next day, sitting on the [a]judgment seat, I ordered the man to be brought.',
'25:18': 'Concerning him the accusers stood and brought no [a]charge of the evil things I was suspecting.',
'25:19': 'But they had certain [a]questions against him concerning their own [1]religion and concerning a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be [b]alive.',
'25:20': 'And [1]being at a loss <I>as</I> <I>to</I> <I>how</I> <I>there</I> <I>should</I> <I>be</I> an inquiry concerning these things, I asked <I>him</I> if he was willing to go to [a]Jerusalem and be judged there concerning these things.',
'25:21': 'But when Paul appealed to be kept <I>in</I> <I>custody</I> for the decision of [1]the [a]Emperor, I ordered him to be kept <I>in</I> <I>custody</I> until I should send him up to Caesar.',
'25:22': 'And Agrippa <I>said</I> to Festus, I myself also would like to hear the man. Tomorrow, said <I>Festus</I>, you shall hear him.',
'25:23': 'Therefore on the next day, when [a]Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered into the hall of audience together with the [1]commanders and prominent men of the city, and when Festus had given the order, Paul was brought.',
'25:24': 'And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you men who are present with us, you behold this man, concerning whom all the multitude of [a]Jews have petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought [b]not to live any longer.',
'25:25': 'But I found that he had done nothing [a]worthy of death; and since he himself [b]appealed to the Emperor, I [1]decided to send <I>him</I>.',
'25:26': 'Concerning him I have nothing definite to write to my lord; therefore I have brought him before [1]you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that when the examination has taken place, I may have something to write.',
'25:27': 'For it seems unreasonable to me, in sending a [a]prisoner, not to also signify the charges against him.',
'26:1': 'And Agrippa said to Paul, You are permitted to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his [a]defense:',
'26:2': 'Concerning all the things which I am [a]accused of by the Jews, [b]King Agrippa, I consider myself blessed that I am to make my [1]defense before you today,',
'26:3': '[1]Especially since you are [2]familiar with all the [a]customs and [b]questions among the Jews; therefore I beg <I>you</I> to listen to me patiently.',
'26:4': 'The manner of my life from youth, which from the beginning was among my <I>own</I> [a]nation and in Jerusalem, all the Jews know,',
'26:5': 'Since they have previously known about me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the [a]strictest [b]sect of our [1]religion I lived as a [c]Pharisee.',
'26:6': 'And now I stand <I>here</I> being judged for the [a]hope of the promise made by God to our fathers,',
'26:7': 'To which our [a]twelve tribes, earnestly serving [b]night and day, hope to attain. Concerning this hope I am [c]accused by the Jews, O king.',
'26:8': 'Why is it judged incredible among you if God [a]raises the dead?',
'26:9': 'Well then, I thought to myself that I ought to do many things [a]contrary to the name of Jesus the [b]Nazarene,',
'26:10': 'Which also I did in Jerusalem; and I both shut up many of the saints in [a]prison when I had received [b]authority from the chief priests and [c]cast a vote against them when they were being done away with.',
'26:11': 'And in all the [a]synagogues I punished them often and tried to compel <I>them</I> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged at them, I [b]persecuted <I>them</I> even as far as [1]foreign cities.',
'26:12': '<I>Engaged</I> in these things, I [a]journeyed to Damascus with authority and a commission from the chief priests.',
'26:13': 'At midday, on the way, I saw, O king, a light from heaven beyond the brightness of the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.',
'26:14': 'And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the [a]Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting [1]Me? It is hard for you to kick against the [2]goads.',
'26:15': 'And I said, Who are You, [1]Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.',
'26:16': 'But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this <I>purpose</I>, to [a]appoint you as a minister and a [1b]witness both of the things in which you have [c]seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you;',
'26:17': 'Delivering you [a]from the people and from the [b]Gentiles, to whom I send you,',
'26:18': 'To [1]open their [a]eyes, to turn <I>them</I> from [2b]darkness to [c]light and <I>from</I> the [3]authority of Satan [4]to God, that they may receive [5d]forgiveness of sins and [6]an [e]inheritance among those who have been [7]sanctified by faith in Me.',
'26:19': 'Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly [1]vision,',
'26:20': 'But declared both to those in [a]Damascus first and in [b]Jerusalem and throughout [c]all the country of Judea and to the [d]Gentiles that they should [e]repent and [f]turn to God, doing works [g]worthy of repentance.',
'26:21': 'Because of these things <I>certain</I> Jews [a]seized me while I was in the temple and tried to slay <I>me</I>.',
'26:22': 'Having therefore obtained the [1a]help which is from God, I have [b]stood unto this day, [c]testifying both to small and great, saying nothing apart from the things which both the [d]prophets and [e]Moses have said would take place,',
'26:23': 'That the Christ would [a]suffer <I>and</I> that He, being the first [1]to [b]rise from the dead, would announce [2c]light both to the people and to the Gentiles.',
'26:24': 'And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, You are [1a]insane, Paul. Much learning is driving you [1]insane.',
'26:25': 'But Paul said, I am not insane, most [a]excellent [b]Festus, but I am uttering words of [c]truth and [d]soberness.',
'26:26': 'For the king [1]knows about these things, to whom also I speak [2]freely, for I am persuaded that none of these things have escaped his notice; for this has not been done in a corner.',
'26:27': 'King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.',
'26:28': 'And Agrippa <I>replied</I> to Paul, By so little are you trying to persuade me to become a [a]Christian?',
'26:29': 'And Paul <I>said</I>, I would to God that both by little and by much, not only you, but also all those who hear me today might become even such [a]as I am, except for these [b]bonds.',
'26:30': 'And the king rose up, and the [a]governor and [b]Bernice and [c]those sitting with them;',
'26:31': 'And when they had withdrawn, they spoke to one another, saying, This man is doing nothing [a]worthy of death or of bonds.',
'26:32': 'And [a]Agrippa said to Festus, [1]This man could have been [b]released, had he [2]not [c]appealed to Caesar.',
'27:1': 'And when it was decided that [1]we should sail to [a]Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius of the [2]Augustan [3]cohort.',
'27:2': 'And going on board an Adramyttian ship which was about to sail to places along <I>the</I> <I>coast</I> <I>of</I> Asia, we [1]put out to sea, [a]Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.',
'27:3': 'And on the next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, treating Paul [a]kindly, allowed <I>him</I> to go to his friends to receive care.',
'27:4': 'And from there we put out to sea and sailed under the shelter of Cyprus because the winds were contrary.',
'27:5': 'And having sailed across the open sea which <I>lies</I> off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came down to Myra of Lycia.',
'27:6': 'And there the centurion found an [a]Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy, and he put us onto it.',
'27:7': 'And when we had sailed slowly for a considerable number of days and came with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to go on, we sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone.',
'27:8': 'And coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.',
'27:9': 'And when considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, <I>and</I> also because the [1]Fast had already gone by, Paul advised <I>them</I>,',
'27:10': 'Saying to them, [1]Men, I perceive that the voyage is to be with damage and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.',
'27:11': 'But the centurion was persuaded by the navigator and the ship&rsquo;s [a]owner rather than by the things that were being said by Paul.',
'27:12': 'And as the harbor was not suitable for wintering, the majority gave counsel to put out to sea from there, if somehow they might be able to reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete [1]facing northeast and southeast, and spend the winter <I>there</I>.',
'27:13': 'And when a south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete close inshore.',
'27:14': 'But not long afterward there beat down from [1]the island a hurricane [a]wind called [2]Euraquilo.',
'27:15': 'And when the ship was caught <I>by</I> <I>it</I> and was not able to face the wind, we gave way <I>to</I> <I>it</I> and were driven along.',
'27:16': 'And running under the shelter of a certain little island called Clauda, we were hardly able to [1]get control of the [a]small boat.',
'27:17': 'And when they had hoisted it up, they [1]used supports to undergird the ship. And because they [a]feared that they might run aground on [2]Syrtis, they [3]lowered the gear and so were driven along.',
'27:18': 'The next day, as we were being violently storm-tossed, they began to [a]jettison the cargo;',
'27:19': 'And on the third day they threw the ship&rsquo;s [1]gear <I>overboard</I>, <I>even</I> with their own hands.',
'27:20': 'And when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and while no small storm was assailing <I>us</I>, from then on all hope that we might be saved was being abandoned.',
'27:21': 'And when they had been a long time without food, Paul then stood in their midst and said, O [1]men, you [2]should have listened to me and not set sail from Crete and gained this damage and loss.',
'27:22': 'And now I advise you to [a]cheer up, for there will be [b]no loss of life among you, but <I>only</I> of the ship.',
'27:23': 'For this very [a]night an [b]angel of the God whose I [c]am and whom I [1d]serve [e]stood by me,',
'27:24': 'Saying, Do [a]not fear, Paul; you must [1]stand before Caesar. And behold, God has [b]granted you all those who are sailing with you.',
'27:25': 'Therefore, [a]cheer up, [1]men, for I [b]believe God that it shall be so, even in the way in which it has been [c]spoken to me.',
'27:26': 'But we must run [a]aground on a certain [b]island.',
'27:27': 'But when the fourteenth night came, as we were being driven about in the Adriatic Sea, about the middle of the night the sailors suspected that some land was approaching them.',
'27:28': 'And they [1]took soundings and found <I>it</I> <I>to</I> <I>be</I> twenty [2]fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they sounded again and found <I>it</I> <I>to</I> <I>be</I> fifteen [2]fathoms.',
'27:29': 'And [a]fearing that we might run [b]aground somewhere on [1]rocky places, they threw four anchors from the stern and wished for day to come.',
'27:30': 'And when the sailors sought to flee from the ship, having lowered the [a]small boat into the sea under pretense of intending to lay out anchors from the bow,',
'27:31': 'Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.',
'27:32': 'Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the small boat and let it fall away.',
'27:33': 'And until day was about to come, Paul encouraged <I>them</I> all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued watching without food, taking nothing.',
'27:34': 'Therefore I encourage you to take some food, for this is for your salvation; for not a [a]hair from the head of any one of you shall perish.',
'27:35': 'And when he had said these things and had taken bread, he gave [a]thanks to God before all; and he broke <I>it</I> and began to [b]eat.',
'27:36': 'And all became [a]cheerful, and they also took food.',
'27:37': 'Now we were in all two hundred and seventy-six souls in the ship.',
'27:38': 'And when they were satisfied with food, they began to lighten the ship, [a]throwing out the wheat into the sea.',
'27:39': 'And when day came, they could not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay, which had a beach, into which they took counsel to drive the ship, if they were able.',
'27:40': 'And casting off the anchors, they left <I>them</I> in the sea, at the same time loosening the bands of the rudders; and hoisting the foresail to the blowing of the wind, they held course for the beach.',
'27:41': 'But striking a sandbar with the sea on both sides, they ran the vessel aground; and the bow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was [a]broken up by the violence of the waves.',
'27:42': 'And the counsel of the soldiers was that they should [a]kill the prisoners, lest anyone swim away and escape;',
'27:43': 'But the centurion, [1]intending to bring Paul safely through, prevented them from their intention and ordered those who were able to swim to throw themselves overboard first and get to the land,',
'27:44': 'And the rest <I>to</I> <I>follow</I>, some on planks, and others on some of the things from the ship. And so it happened that all were brought [a]safely through onto the land.',
'28:1': 'And having been brought safely through, we recognized then that the [a]island was called [1]Malta.',
'28:2': 'And the [1]natives showed us uncommon [a]kindness, for they kindled a fire and took us all in because of the rain coming on and because of the cold.',
'28:3': 'But when Paul had collected a bundle of sticks and put <I>them</I> on the fire, a [a]viper came out because of the heat and fastened onto his hand.',
'28:4': 'And when the natives saw the [1]snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, Undoubtedly this man is a murderer, whom, though he has been brought safely out of the sea, [2]Justice has not allowed to live.',
'28:5': 'However he shook off the [a]snake into the fire and suffered no harm;',
'28:6': 'And they expected that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited for a long time and beheld nothing unusual happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a [1a]god.',
'28:7': 'Now in the vicinity of that place were the lands of the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and gave <I>us</I> hospitality three days in a [a]friendly way.',
'28:8': 'And the father of Publius was lying down sick with [a]fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him, and having [b]prayed and [c]laid his hands on him, healed him.',
'28:9': 'And when this happened, the rest also in the island who had sicknesses came to <I>him</I> and were [1]healed.',
'28:10': 'They also honored us with many honors; and as we put out to sea, they put on <I>board</I> the things for our needs.',
'28:11': 'And after <I>it</I> <I>had</I> <I>been</I> three months, we put out to sea in an [a]Alexandrian ship which had wintered in the island, with the [1]twin sons of [b]Zeus for <I>its</I> figurehead.',
'28:12': 'And having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days.',
'28:13': 'From there we sailed around and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind came on, and the second day we came to Puteoli,',
'28:14': 'Where, having found [a]brothers, we were urged to remain with them seven days. And thus we came to Rome.',
'28:15': 'And from [1]there the [2]brothers, having heard about the things concerning us, came as far as the [3]Market of Appius and [4]Three Inns to meet us; <I>and</I> when Paul saw them, he thanked God and [5]took courage.',
'28:16': 'And when we entered into Rome, Paul was permitted to remain by himself with the soldier who was [a]guarding him.',
'28:17': 'And after three days he called together those who were the leading men of the Jews; and when they came together, he said to them, [1]Men, brothers, though I have done [a]nothing against the people or the [b]customs of our fathers, I have been delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,',
'28:18': 'Who, having examined me, intended to [a]release <I>me</I>, because there was not one [b]cause of death in me.',
'28:19': 'But when the Jews spoke against <I>this</I>, I was compelled to [a]appeal to Caesar, not that I have anything to accuse my [b]nation of.',
'28:20': 'For this cause therefore, I have entreated you to see <I>me</I> and speak with <I>me</I>; for on account of the [a]hope of Israel I have this [b]chain around <I>me</I>.',
'28:21': 'And they said to him, We have neither received [a]letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers come and reported or spoken anything evil concerning you.',
'28:22': 'But we think it is fitting to hear from you what you think, for concerning this [a]sect it is indeed known to us that it is [b]spoken against everywhere.',
'28:23': 'And once they had appointed a day for him, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he [a]expounded <I>these</I> <I>matters</I>, solemnly [b]testifying of the [1c]kingdom of God and [d]persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of [e]Moses and the [f]Prophets, from morning until evening.',
'28:24': 'And [a]some were persuaded by the things which were said, but others did not believe.',
'28:25': 'And when they disagreed with one another, they departed, Paul saying one word <I>to</I> <I>them</I>, Well has the Holy Spirit spoken through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers,',
'28:26': 'Saying, [1]&ldquo;Go to this people and say, In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you will see and by no means perceive;',
'28:27': 'For the [a]heart of this people has become [1]fat, and with their ears they have heard heavily, and their [b]eyes they have closed, lest they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart, and they turn around, and I will heal them.&rdquo;',
'28:28': 'Let it be known to you therefore that this [a]salvation of God has been sent to the [b]Gentiles; they will also [c]hear <I>it</I>.',

Isaiah charged the seekers of God to call upon Him ({Isa55:6|Isa. 55:6}). Even the Gentiles knew that the prophets of Israel had the habit of calling on the name of God ({Jon1:6|Jonah 1:6}; {2Ki5:11|2&nbsp;Kings 5:11}). The Gentile raised up by God from the north also called upon His name ({Isa41:25|Isa. 41:25}). It is God&rsquo;s commandment ({Psa50:15|Psa. 50:15}; {Jer29:12|Jer. 29:12}) and desire ({Psa91:15|Psa. 91:15}; {Zep3:9|Zeph. 3:9}; {Zec13:9|Zech. 13:9}) that His people call on Him. This is the joyful way to drink from the fountain of God&rsquo;s salvation ({Isa12:3|Isa. 12:3}-{Isa12:4|4}) and the enjoyable way to delight oneself in God ({Job27:10|Job 27:10}), that is, to enjoy Him. Hence, God&rsquo;s people must call upon Him daily ({Psa88:9|Psa. 88:9}). Such a jubilant practice was prophesied by Joel ({Joe2:32|Joel 2:32}) concerning the New Testament jubilee.","In the New Testament, calling on the name of the Lord was first mentioned by Peter, here, on the day of Pentecost, as the fulfillment of Joel&rsquo;s prophecy. This fulfillment is related to God&rsquo;s outpouring of the all-inclusive Spirit economically upon His chosen people that they may participate in His New Testament jubilee. Joel&rsquo;s prophecy and its fulfillment concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament jubilee have two aspects: on God&rsquo;s side, He poured out His Spirit in the ascension of the resurrected Christ; on our side, we call on the name of the ascended Lord, who has accomplished all, attained unto all, and obtained all. Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is vitally necessary in order for us, the believers in Christ, to participate in and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ with all He has accomplished, attained, and obtained ({1Co1:2|1&nbsp;Cor. 1:2}). It is a major practice in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy that enables us to enjoy the processed Triune God for our full salvation ({Rom10:10|Rom. 10:10}-{Rom10:13|13}). The early believers practiced this everywhere ({1Co1:2|1&nbsp;Cor. 1:2}), and to the unbelievers, especially the persecutors, it became a popular sign of Christ&rsquo;s believers ({Act9:14|9:14}, {Act9:21|21}). When Stephen suffered persecution, he practiced this ({Act7:59|7:59}), and his practice surely impressed Saul, one of his persecutors ({Act7:58|7:58}-{Act7:60|60}; {Act22:20|22:20}). Later, the unbelieving Saul persecuted the callers ({Act9:14|9:14}, {Act9:21|21}) by taking their calling as a sign. Immediately after Saul was caught by the Lord, Ananias, who brought Saul into the fellowship of the Body of Christ, charged him to be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord, to show others that he too had become such a caller. By his word to Timothy in {2Ti2:22|2&nbsp;Tim. 2:22}, Paul indicated that in the early days all the Lord&rsquo;s seekers practiced such calling. Undoubtedly, he was one who practiced this, since he charged his young co-worker Timothy to do this that Timothy might enjoy the Lord as he did.","The Greek word for call on is composed of on and call (by name); thus, it is to call out audibly, even loudly, as Stephen did ({Act7:59|7:59}-{Act7:60|60})."]},

God&rsquo;s outpouring of His Spirit is the applying of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation to His chosen people. To be saved is to receive this Spirit, who is the blessing of the gospel in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy ({Gal3:2|Gal. 3:2}, {Gal3:5|5}, {Gal3:14|14}). This Spirit is the Lord Himself as the breath ({Joh20:22|John 20:22}) and the living water ({Joh4:10|John 4:10}, {Joh4:14|14}) to us. To breathe Him in as our breath and drink Him as our living water, we need to call on Him. {Lam3:55|Lamentations 3:55}-{Lam3:56|56} indicates that our calling on the Lord is our breathing, and {Isa12:3|Isa. 12:3}-{Isa12:4|4} indicates that our calling on the Lord is our drinking. After we believe in the Lord, we need to call on Him that we may not only be saved but also enjoy His riches ({Rom10:12|Rom. 10:12}-{Rom10:13|13}). When we exercise our spirit to call on Him, breathe Him in, and drink Him, we enjoy His riches; this is the real worship to God. The Lord connected such worship ({Joh4:24|John 4:24}) to the drinking of the living water given by Him ({Joh4:14|John 4:14})."]},

The result of such a salvation was not their entering into heaven but their entering into a new generation&mdash;the church. Thus, the saved ones were separated from the Jewish society into the church.

The opposing Jews twisted the believers&rsquo; words, just as in {Mat27:40|Matt. 27:40}, when they crucified the Lord, they twisted the word that the Lord spoke in {Joh2:19|John 2:19}. Undoubtedly, the Jews&rsquo; opposition was instigated by Satan to frustrate God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. But the ground used by Satan for his instigation was the change of dispensation, which contradicted the Judaic traditions. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have a new dispensation absolutely separated from Judaism. This offended the Jews by touching the traditions they had inherited for generations, and it stirred up their opposition, which began with the Lord&rsquo;s ministry in the Gospels and grew more fierce at the time of the apostles&rsquo; ministry in this book, during which the Lord&rsquo;s New Testament move was passing through a transitional period. According to Luke&rsquo;s narration in Acts, the church among the Jews, including the early apostles, did not pass through this transition successfully, because of the remaining influence of their Judaic background and the entangling opposition from their Jewish kinsmen. This problem returned to trouble them again and again in this book ({Act11:1|11:1}-{Act11:3|3}; {Act15:1|15:1}-{Act15:5|5}; {Act21:18|21:18}-{Act21:26|26}).

These other cases were merely the believers&rsquo; experiences of the once-for-all-accomplished baptism in the Holy Spirit.","In this book, concerning the believers&rsquo; receiving of the Holy Spirit economically, that is, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s falling upon them, only five cases are mentioned.

Nonetheless, he still had a burden to spare part of his time for the needy saints in Jerusalem. When he arrived in Corinth, he wrote his Epistle to the saints in Rome, expressing the purpose of his trip and begging them to pray for him concerning this purpose ({Rom15:25|Rom. 15:25}-{Rom15:31|31}). Although he was an apostle set apart by God for the Gentiles ({Act22:21|22:21}; {Gal2:8|Gal. 2:8}), Paul was still concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s interest among the Jews. His primary concern was for the Body of Christ universally, not merely for his part of the New Testament ministry among the Gentiles.","Besides this, his purpose in going to Jerusalem at this juncture might also have been to fellowship with James and the other apostles and elders in Jerusalem regarding the Judaic influence on the church there. According to Paul&rsquo;s teachings in the Epistles to the Galatians and the Romans, the decision made by the conference of the apostles and elders in {Act15|ch. 15} to resolve the problem concerning circumcision must not have been fully satisfactory to him.

To do this Paul had to enter into the temple and remain there with the Nazarites until the completion of the seven days of the vow; then the priest would offer the offerings for each one of them, including him. Surely he was clear that such a practice was of the outdated dispensation, which, according to the principle of his teaching in the New Testament ministry, should be repudiated in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Yet he went through with it, probably because of his Jewish background, which had also been manifested earlier in his private vow in {Act18:18|18:18}, and probably because he was practicing his word in {1Co9:20|1&nbsp;Cor. 9:20}. However, his toleration jeopardized God&rsquo;s New Testament economy; this God would not tolerate. At this point he must have felt that he was in a predicament, and he must have been deeply troubled, longing to be delivered from it. Just at the time when their vow was to be concluded, God allowed an uproar to rise up against him, and what they intended to accomplish was blown away ({Act21:27|v. 27}). Moreover, by God&rsquo;s sovereignty Paul was rescued out of his predicament.","The mixing of Judaic practices with God&rsquo;s New Testament economy was not only erroneous in relation to God&rsquo;s dispensation but also abominable in the eyes of God. This gross mixture was terminated by Him a mere ten years or so later with the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, the center of Judaism, through Titus and his Roman army. This rescued and absolutely separated the church from the devastation of Judaism.","God might have tolerated Paul&rsquo;s carrying out of a private vow in {Act18:18|18:18}, but He would not allow Paul, a vessel chosen by Him not only for the completing of His New Testament revelation ({Col1:25|Col. 1:25}) but also for the carrying out of His New Testament economy ({Eph3:2|Eph. 3:2}, {Eph3:7|7}-{Eph3:8|8}), to participate in the Nazarite vow, a strict Judaic practice. In going to Jerusalem, Paul&rsquo;s intention might have been to clear up the Judaic influence on the church there (see {Act19:21^1P2|note 21<sup>1</sup>, par. 2}, in {Act19|ch. 19}), but God knew that the church there was incurable. Hence, in His sovereignty God allowed Paul to be arrested by the Jews and imprisoned by the Romans that he might write his last eight Epistles (see {Act25:11^1|note 11<sup>1</sup>} in {Act25|ch. 25}), which completed the divine revelation ({Col1:25|Col. 1:25}) and gave the church a clearer and deeper view concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy ({Eph3:3|Eph. 3:3}-{Eph3:4|4}). Thus, God left the Judaism-influenced church in Jerusalem to remain as it was until the devastating mixture was terminated with the destruction of Jerusalem. For Paul to write his last eight Epistles to complete God&rsquo;s New Testament revelation was far more important and necessary than for him to accomplish some outward works for the church."]},

After the judgment of the flood, God ordained that man should be under human government ({Gen9:6|Gen. 9:6}). Man failed in this also. Then, before fulfilling His promise to Abraham concerning the blessing of the nations in his seed, Christ ({Gen12:3|Gen. 12:3}; {Gal3:8|Gal. 3:8}), God put man under the test of the law ({Rom3:20|Rom. 3:20}; {Rom5:20|5:20}).

All these failures indicate that man has fallen from God to his conscience, from his conscience to human government, and from human government to lawlessness; that is, man has fallen to the uttermost.

Thus, He turned to the Gentiles for the carrying out of His New Testament economy in the spreading of His kingdom for the building up of the churches through the propagation of the resurrected and ascended Christ ({Act28:28|v. 28})."]},

Luke&rsquo;s writing here both begins ({Act1:3|1:3}) and ends with the kingdom of God.","This book was not actually ended; rather, it was left open that more may be added. The reason for this must have been that the work of the Holy Spirit in preaching Christ for His propagation, multiplication, and spread through the believers of Christ was not yet completed and needed to be continued for a long period of time. Such an evangelistic work for Christ&rsquo;s propagation, multiplication, and spread is according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy for the producing of many sons for God ({Rom8:29|Rom. 8:29}) that they might be the members of Christ to constitute His Body ({Rom12:5|Rom. 12:5}) for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s eternal plan and the fulfillment of His eternal will. This is revealed in detail in the twenty-one Epistles and the book of Revelation, which follow this book. The church produced by Christ&rsquo;s propagation and multiplication is the sphere in which God is expressed and in which He reigns in Christ; hence, the church becomes the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God, along with Christ&rsquo;s propagation and multiplication, grows out of and spreads from God&rsquo;s life. Acts is a record of the spreading of Christ; it is also a record of the kingdom of God, because the kingdom of God is the expansion of Christ. The gospel that is widely preached in this book is the very Christ as the gospel ({Act5:42|5:42}), the gospel of Christ, and it is also the kingdom of God as the gospel ({Act8:12|8:12}), the gospel of the kingdom of God. The preaching of such a gospel will continue and advance until the whole earth becomes the kingdom of Christ ({Rev11:15|Rev. 11:15}).","In the four Gospels God was incarnated, passed through human living, died, and resurrected, thus completing Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God ({Col2:9|Col. 2:9}). In Acts this embodiment of God, as the life-giving Spirit ({1Co15:45|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45}), spreads Christ into His believers, i.e., works the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, and transformed people to make them the constituents of the church, through which God may be expressed. The ultimate issue of the church will be the New Jerusalem in eternity future as God&rsquo;s full and eternal expression, which will also be God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom as the sphere in which He reigns in His divine life in eternity forever and ever. This should be the reality and goal of all gospel preaching today."]},
