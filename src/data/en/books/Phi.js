'1:1': 'Paul and Timothy, [a]slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the [b]saints in Christ Jesus who are in [1c]Philippi, [2]with the [3d]overseers and [4e]deacons:',
'1:2': '[1a]Grace to you and [2]peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.',
'1:3': 'I [a]thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,',
'1:4': 'Always in my every [a]petition on behalf of you all, making my [a]petition with [b]joy,',
'1:5': 'For your [1a]fellowship unto <I>the</I> <I>furtherance</I> <I>of</I> the [2b]gospel from the first day until now,',
'1:6': 'Being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun in you a good work will complete it until the [a]day of Christ Jesus;',
'1:7': 'Even as it is right for me to think this concerning you all because you have me in your heart, since both in my [a]bonds and in the [1b]defense and confirmation of the gospel you are all [2]fellow partakers [3]with me of grace.',
'1:8': 'For God is my [a]witness how I [b]long after you all in the [1c]inward parts of Christ Jesus.',
'1:9': 'And this I pray, that your [a]love may abound yet more and more in [1b]full knowledge and all [2]discernment,',
'1:10': 'So that you may [a]approve by testing the things which differ and are more excellent, that you may be [1]pure and [2]without offense unto the [b]day of Christ,',
'1:11': 'Being filled with the [1a]fruit of righteousness, which is [b]through Jesus Christ, to the [c]glory and praise of God.',
'1:12': 'Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things concerning me have turned out rather to the [1]advancement of the [a]gospel,',
'1:13': 'So that my [a]bonds have become manifest <I>as</I> <I>being</I> [1]in Christ among the whole [2]Praetorian guard and to all the rest.',
'1:14': 'And most of the brothers, being confident in the Lord because of my bonds, are more exceedingly bold to speak the word of God without fear.',
'1:15': '[1]Some preach Christ even because of [a]envy and [2]strife, and [3]some also because of good will,',
'1:16': 'These out of love, knowing that I am set for the [a]defense of the gospel.',
'1:17': 'But the others announce Christ out of [1]selfish ambition, not purely, thinking to raise up [2]affliction in my [a]bonds.',
'1:18': 'What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truthfulness, Christ is announced; and in this I [1a]rejoice; yes, and I will rejoice;',
'1:19': 'For I know that for me this will turn out to [1a]salvation through [2]your [b]petition and <I>the</I> [3]bountiful [c]supply of the [4d]Spirit of Jesus Christ,',
'1:20': 'According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to [a]shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be [1]magnified [b]in my body, whether through life or through [c]death.',
'1:21': 'For to me, to [1a]live is Christ and to die is [2]gain.',
'1:22': 'But if I am to live in the flesh, if this to me is [a]fruit for <I>my</I> work, then I do not know what I will choose.',
'1:23': 'But I am constrained between the two, having the desire to [a]depart and be [1]with Christ, for <I>this</I> <I>is</I> far better;',
'1:24': 'But to remain in the flesh is more necessary for [1]your sake.',
'1:25': 'And being confident of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your [1]progress and [a]joy of [2]the [b]faith,',
'1:26': 'That your [1]boast may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my coming again to you.',
'1:27': 'Only, conduct yourselves in a manner [a]worthy of the [b]gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you [c]stand firm in one spirit, with [1d]one soul [2e]striving together <I>along</I> with [3]the faith of the gospel,',
'1:28': 'And in nothing being frightened by the opposers, which is to them a [a]proof of <I>their</I> [1b]destruction, but of your [2]salvation, and that from God;',
'1:29': 'Because to you it has been graciously granted on behalf of Christ not only to believe [1]into Him but also to [2a]suffer on His behalf,',
'1:30': 'Having the same [a]struggle which you saw in [1]me and now hear <I>to</I> <I>be</I> in me.',
'2:1': '[1]If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any [2a]consolation of love, if any [b]fellowship of spirit, if any [3c]tenderheartedness and [d]compassions,',
'2:2': '[1]Make my [2a]joy full, that you [3b]think the same thing, having the [4]same love, [5c]joined in soul, [3]thinking [6]the one thing,',
'2:3': '[1]<I>Doing</I> nothing by way of [2a]selfish ambition nor by way of [b]vainglory, but in [3c]lowliness of [4]mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves;',
'2:4': 'Not regarding each his own [1]virtues, but each the [1]virtues of others also.',
'2:5': '[1]Let [a]this mind be in you, which was also in [2]Christ Jesus,',
'2:6': 'Who, [1a]existing in the [2b]form of God, did [3]not consider being [c]equal with God a treasure to be grasped,',
'2:7': 'But [1a]emptied Himself, taking the [2]form of a [b]slave, [3c]becoming in the [4]likeness of men;',
'2:8': 'And [1]being found in [2]fashion as a man, He [3]humbled Himself, becoming [a]obedient even unto death, and <I>that</I> the [4]death of a [b]cross.',
'2:9': 'Therefore also God highly [1a]exalted Him and [2]bestowed on Him the [3]name which is [b]above every name,',
'2:10': 'That [1]in the name of Jesus [a]every knee should [2]bow, of those who are [3]in [b]heaven and [4]on earth and [5]under the earth,',
'2:11': 'And every tongue should [1]openly confess that Jesus Christ is [2a]Lord [3]to the [b]glory of God the Father.',
'2:12': '[1]So then, my beloved, even as you have always [2]obeyed, not as in my presence only but now much rather in my absence, [3]work out your own [4a]salvation with [5b]fear and trembling;',
'2:13': '[1]For it is [2]God who [3a]operates in you both the [4]willing and the [5]working for <I>His</I> [6b]good pleasure.',
'2:14': 'Do all things without [1a]murmurings and [b]reasonings',
'2:15': 'That you may be [a]blameless and [1]guileless, [2]children of God [3b]without blemish in the midst of a [c]crooked and [4]perverted generation, among whom you shine as [5d]luminaries in the [6]world,',
'2:16': '[1]Holding forth the [2a]word of life, so that I may have a [3b]boast in the [4c]day of Christ that I did not [d]run in vain nor [e]labor in vain.',
'2:17': 'But even if I am being [a]poured out as a [1b]drink offering upon the [2c]sacrifice and [3]service of your [4]faith, I [5d]rejoice, and I [6]rejoice together with you all.',
'2:18': 'And in like manner you also rejoice, and you [1]rejoice together with me.',
'2:19': 'But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send [a]Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be [1]encouraged by knowing the things concerning you.',
'2:20': 'For I have no one [1a]like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you;',
'2:21': 'For all [a]seek their own things, not the things of [1]Christ Jesus.',
'2:22': 'But you know his [1]approvedness, that as a [a]child with a father he has [2b]served with me unto the [c]gospel.',
'2:23': 'Him therefore I hope to send immediately, as soon as I see how things go with me.',
'2:24': 'But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will [a]come shortly.',
'2:25': 'But I considered it necessary to send to you [a]Epaphroditus, my [1]brother and [b]fellow worker and [c]fellow soldier, and your [2d]apostle and [3]minister to my [e]need,',
'2:26': 'Since he [a]longed after you all and was greatly distressed because you heard that he had become sick;',
'2:27': 'For indeed he had become [a]sick, near to death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only but also on me that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.',
'2:28': 'I have sent him therefore the more eagerly, so that when you see him again, you may [a]rejoice and I may be less sorrowful.',
'2:29': '[a]Receive him therefore in the Lord with all [b]joy, and [c]hold such in honor,',
'2:30': 'Because for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, [1a]risking his [2]life, that he might [b]fill up your lack of [3]service toward me.',
'3:1': 'Finally, my brothers, [a]rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, for me it is not [1]irksome, but for you it is [2]safe.',
'3:2': '[1]Beware of the [2a]dogs, beware of the [2]evil [b]workers, beware of the [2c]concision.',
'3:3': 'For we are the [1a]circumcision, the ones who [2]serve by the Spirit of God and [b]boast in Christ Jesus and [3]have no confidence in the [4c]flesh,',
'3:4': 'Though I myself have <I>something</I> to be confident of in the [a]flesh as well. If any other man thinks that he has confidence in the flesh, I more:',
'3:5': 'Circumcised the [1a]eighth day; of the [2b]race of Israel, of the [3]tribe of Benjamin, a [4c]Hebrew <I>born</I> of Hebrews; as to the [5d]law, a [6e]Pharisee;',
'3:6': 'As to [1a]zeal, [b]persecuting the church; as to the [c]righteousness which is in the law, become [2d]blameless.',
'3:7': '[1]But what [2]things were gains to me, these I have counted as [3]loss [4]on account of Christ.',
'3:8': '[1]But moreover I [2]also count [a]all things to be loss on account of the [3]excellency of the [b]knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, [4]on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count <I>them</I> as [5]refuse that I may [6c]gain Christ',
'3:9': 'And be [1]found in Him, [2]not having my own [a]righteousness which is [3]out of the law, but that which is through [4b]faith in Christ, the [5c]righteousness which is out of God <I>and</I> [6]<I>based</I> on faith,',
'3:10': 'To [1a]know Him and the [2b]power of His resurrection and the [3c]fellowship of His sufferings, being [4d]conformed to His death,',
'3:11': 'If perhaps I may [1]attain to the [2a]out-[b]resurrection from the dead.',
'3:12': '[1]Not that I [2]have already [a]obtained or [3]am already [4b]perfected, but I [5c]pursue, if even I may [6]lay hold of [7]that for which [d]I also have been [8]laid hold of by Christ Jesus.',
'3:13': 'Brothers, I do [1]not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: [2]Forgetting the things which are [a]behind and [3]stretching forward to the things which are before,',
'3:14': 'I [1a]pursue toward the [2]goal for the [3b]prize to which God in Christ Jesus has [4c]called <I>me</I> upward.',
'3:15': 'Let us therefore, as many as are [1a]full-grown, have [2b]this mind; and if in anything you are [c]otherwise minded, this also God will [3d]reveal to you.',
'3:16': '[1]Nevertheless [2]whereunto we have attained, by the [3]same <I>rule</I> let us [4a]walk.',
'3:17': 'Be [a]imitators together of me, brothers, and observe those who thus walk even as you have us as a [b]pattern.',
'3:18': 'For [1]many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even [a]weeping, <I>that</I> <I>they</I> <I>are</I> the enemies of the [2b]cross of Christ,',
'3:19': '[1]Whose end is [a]destruction, whose god is their [b]stomach, and <I>whose</I> glory is in their [c]shame, who [d]set their minds on [2]earthly things.',
'3:20': 'For our [1a]commonwealth exists in the [2b]heavens, from which also we eagerly [c]await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,',
'3:21': 'Who will [1a]transfigure the [2b]body of our humiliation to be [c]conformed to the [3]body of His [d]glory, [4]according to His operation by which He is able even to [e]subject all things to Himself.',
'4:1': 'So then, my brothers, beloved and [a]longed for, my [1b]joy and [c]crown, [2]in the same way [d]stand firm in the Lord, beloved.',
'4:2': 'I exhort Euodias, and I exhort Syntyche, to [1a]think the same thing in the Lord.',
'4:3': 'Yes, I ask you also, genuine [1]yokefellow, [2]assist them, since they [3]contended with me in the gospel, as well as with Clement and the rest of my [a]fellow workers, whose [b]names are in the [4c]book of life.',
'4:4': '[1a]Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice.',
'4:5': '[1]Let your [2]forbearance be known to all men. The Lord is [3a]near.',
'4:6': 'In nothing [1]be [a]anxious, but in everything, by [2b]prayer and petition [3]with [c]thanksgiving, let your requests be made known [4]to God;',
'4:7': 'And the [1a]peace of God, which [b]surpasses every <I>man&rsquo;s</I> understanding, will [2c]guard your [3]hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.',
'4:8': 'Finally, brothers, what things are [1]true, what things are [2]dignified, what things are [3]righteous, what things are [4a]pure, what things are [5]lovely, what things are [6b]well spoken of, if there is any [7c]virtue and if any [8]praise, [9]take account of these things.',
'4:9': 'The things which you have also learned and [1a]received and heard and [2]seen in me, [3]practice these things; and the [4b]God of peace will be with you.',
'4:10': 'But I [a]rejoiced in the Lord greatly because now at length you have caused your thinking for me to [1]blossom anew; for which matter you had indeed taken thought, but lacked opportunity.',
'4:11': 'Not that I speak according to [a]lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be [1b]content.',
'4:12': 'I know also how to be [1]abased, and I know how to [2]abound; [3]in everything and in all things [4]I have learned the secret both to be [5]filled and to [a]hunger, both to [6]abound and to [7b]lack.',
'4:13': 'I am able to do all things [1]in Him who [2a]empowers me.',
'4:14': 'Nevertheless you did well to have [1a]fellowship with me in my [2]affliction.',
'4:15': 'And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the [a]gospel, when I [b]went out from [c]Macedonia, no church had [1]fellowship with me in the [2d]account of [3]giving and receiving except [4]you only;',
'4:16': 'For even in [a]Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my [b]need.',
'4:17': 'Not that I seek the [1]gift, but I seek the [2a]fruit which increases to your [3b]account.',
'4:18': 'But I have received in full all things and abound; I have been [1]filled, receiving from [a]Epaphroditus the [2]things from you, a [3]sweet-smelling savor, an acceptable [4b]sacrifice, well pleasing to God.',
'4:19': 'And [1]my God will [2a]fill [3]your every need [4]according to His riches, [5]in glory, [6]in Christ Jesus.',
'4:20': 'Now to [1]our God and Father be the [2a]glory forever and ever. [3]Amen.',
'4:21': 'Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.',
'4:22': 'All the [a]saints greet you, and especially [1]those of Caesar&rsquo;s household.',
'4:23': 'The [1a]grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your [2b]spirit.',

This kind of fellowship, which kept them from being individualistic and diversely minded, implies that they were one with the apostle Paul and with one another. This gave them the ground for their experience and enjoyment of Christ, which is the main point of this book. The Christ-experiencing and -enjoying life is a life in the furtherance of the gospel, a gospel-preaching life, not individualistic but corporate.

Here, at the end of the book, we are told that our experience and enjoyment of Christ must take place in our spirit, which has been regenerated to be the dwelling place and vessel of the Triune God. Therefore, this is altogether a matter of the union and mingling of the processed Triune God, who has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, and the spirit of us, the tripartite men, who are being transformed by such a Spirit. We must live and act in our wonderful spirit by the Triune God as the wonderful Spirit. Only then can we experience and enjoy the Triune God, who was processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, as the inexhaustibly sufficient grace and thus become His fullness, His expression."]},
