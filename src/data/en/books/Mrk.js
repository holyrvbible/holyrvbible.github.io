verses: {
'1:1': 'The [1]beginning of the [2]gospel of [3]Jesus Christ, [4]the [a]Son of God,',
'1:2': '[1]Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet: [a]&ldquo;Behold, [2]I send My [3]messenger before [4]Your face, who will [5]prepare Your way,',
'1:3': '[a]A [1]voice of one crying in the [2]wilderness: [3]Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.&rdquo;',
'1:4': '[a]John [1]came baptizing in the [2b]wilderness and preaching a [3c]baptism of [d]repentance [4]for [e]forgiveness of sins.',
'1:5': 'And all the [a]region of [1]Judea went out to him, and all the <I>people</I> of Jerusalem; and they were [2]baptized by him in the [3]Jordan River, as they [b]confessed their sins.',
'1:6': 'And John was [1]clothed in camel&rsquo;s [a]hair and <I>had</I> a leather girdle around his loins, and he ate [b]locusts and wild [c]honey.',
'1:7': 'And he preached, saying, [1a]He who is stronger than I comes after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.',
'1:8': 'I have baptized you in [1a]water, but He Himself will baptize you in the Holy [1b]Spirit.',
'1:9': 'And in those days Jesus [a]came from [1b]Nazareth of Galilee and was [2]baptized [3]in the Jordan by John.',
'1:10': 'And [1a]immediately, coming up out of the water, He saw the [2]heavens being [b]parted and the [c]Spirit as a [3]dove descending upon Him[4].',
'1:11': 'And a [a]voice came out of the heavens: [1]You are My Son, the [b]Beloved; in You I have found My [c]delight.',
'1:12': 'And [a]immediately the Spirit [1]thrust Him out into the [b]wilderness.',
'1:13': 'And He was in the wilderness [1]forty days, being [a]tempted by [2]Satan; and He was with the wild animals, and the [b]angels ministered to Him.',
'1:14': 'And after John was [a]delivered up, Jesus came into [1]Galilee, [2b]proclaiming the [c]gospel [3]of God,',
'1:15': 'And saying, The time is [a]fulfilled and the [1b]kingdom of God has drawn near. [2c]Repent and [3d]believe in the [4]gospel.',
'1:16': 'And [a]passing beside the [1b]Sea of Galilee, He saw [c]Simon and Andrew, Simon&rsquo;s brother, [2]casting a [3d]net in the sea, for they were fishermen.',
'1:17': 'And Jesus said to them, Come after Me, and I will cause you to become fishers of men.',
'1:18': 'And [a]immediately leaving the nets, they [1b]followed Him.',
'1:19': 'And going on a little, He saw James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee and [a]John his brother, who also <I>were</I> in their boat, [1]mending the nets.',
'1:20': 'And [a]immediately He [b]called them, and leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they [1]went after Him.',
'1:21': 'And they [a]went into [b]Capernaum, and [c]immediately, on the Sabbath, He entered into the [1d]synagogue and [2]taught.',
'1:22': 'And they were [a]astounded at His [b]teaching, for He taught them as One having [1]authority and not like the scribes.',
'1:23': 'And [a]immediately, there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean [1]spirit, and he cried out, saying,',
'1:24': '[1]What have we to [a]do with You, Jesus, [b]Nazarene? Have You come to destroy us? I [c]know who You are&mdash;the [d]Holy One of God.',
'1:25': 'And Jesus [a]rebuked him, saying, Be [b]quiet and come out of him!',
'1:26': 'And the [a]unclean spirit, [b]convulsing him and shouting with a [c]loud voice, came out of him.',
'1:27': 'And they were all [a]amazed, so that they discussed among themselves, saying, What is this? A [b]new teaching! With [1c]authority He orders even the unclean spirits, and they [d]obey Him.',
'1:28': 'And [a]immediately the report concerning Him went out everywhere into all the surrounding region of Galilee.',
'1:29': 'And immediately, going out of the synagogue, they came into the [a]house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.',
'1:30': 'And Simon&rsquo;s [a]mother-in-law was lying down with a [1]fever, and [b]immediately they told Him about her.',
'1:31': 'And He came to <I>her</I> and raised her up, [a]holding her hand, and the fever [1]left her, and she [2]served them.',
'1:32': 'And when evening fell and the sun had set, they brought to Him all those who were ill and those who were demon-possessed.',
'1:33': 'And the whole city was [a]gathered together at the door.',
'1:34': 'And He [1]healed many who were ill with various [a]diseases, and He [2]cast out many demons and did [b]not allow the demons to speak, because [3]they [c]knew Him.',
'1:35': 'And rising very [a]early in the morning, <I>while</I> <I>it</I> <I>was</I> <I>still</I> night, He went out and went away to a deserted place, and there He [1b]prayed.',
'1:36': 'And Simon and those with him hunted for Him,',
'1:37': 'And they found Him and said to Him, All are seeking You.',
'1:38': 'And He said to them, Let us go [a]elsewhere into the nearby towns that I may [1b]preach there also, because for [2]this <I>purpose</I> I [c]came out.',
'1:39': 'And He went preaching in their [a]synagogues in the whole of Galilee and casting out the demons.',
'1:40': 'And a [1a]leper came to Him, entreating Him and [b]falling on his knees and saying to Him, If You are willing, You can [c]cleanse me.',
'1:41': 'And He was moved with [1]compassion, and [2]stretching out His hand, He touched him and said to him, I am [1]willing; be [3]cleansed!',
'1:42': 'And [a]immediately the leprosy left him, and he was [b]cleansed.',
'1:43': 'And sternly [a]charging him, immediately He thrust him out,',
'1:44': 'And said to him, See that you [1]say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the [a]priest and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.',
'1:45': 'But he went out and began to [a]proclaim <I>it</I> much and to spread the [1]matter abroad, so that He could [2]no longer enter openly into a city, but He stayed outside in [b]deserted places. And they [c]came to Him from everywhere.',
'2:1': 'And [1]He entered again into [a]Capernaum after <I>a</I> <I>few</I> days, and it was heard that He was [2]at home.',
'2:2': 'And many were [a]gathered together, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door. And He spoke to them the word.',
'2:3': 'And they came, bringing to Him a [1a]paralytic carried by four men.',
'2:4': 'And being unable to bring <I>him</I> to Him because of the crowd, they [1]removed the [a]roof where He was. And when they had dug through, they lowered the [2]mat on which the paralytic was lying.',
'2:5': 'And Jesus, seeing their [1a]faith, said to the paralytic, [2]Child, your [3]sins are [b]forgiven.',
'2:6': 'But some of the [1]scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,',
'2:7': 'Why is this <I>man</I> speaking this way? He is [a]blaspheming! Who can forgive [b]sins except One, [1]God?',
'2:8': 'And [a]immediately Jesus, [1b]knowing fully in His spirit that they were reasoning this way within themselves, said to them, Why are you reasoning about these things in your hearts?',
'2:9': 'Which is [1]easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk?',
'2:10': 'But that you may know that the [a]Son of [1]Man has authority to forgive sins on earth&mdash;He said to the paralytic,',
'2:11': 'To you I say, [1]Rise, [a]take up your mat and go to your house.',
'2:12': 'And he [1]rose and immediately [2]took up the mat and [3]went out before <I>them</I> all, so that they were all [a]amazed and [b]glorified God, saying, We have never seen <I>anything</I> like this!',
'2:13': 'And He went out again beside the [a]sea. And all the [b]crowd came to Him, and He [1]taught them.',
'2:14': '[1]And as He passed by, He saw Levi the <I>son</I> of Alphaeus sitting at the [2a]tax office, and He said to him, Follow Me. And he rose and [3]followed Him.',
'2:15': 'And as He reclined <I>at</I> <I>table</I> in his house, many [a]tax collectors and sinners were reclining together with Jesus and His disciples, for there were many, and they were following Him.',
'2:16': 'And the [1a]scribes of the Pharisees, seeing that He ate with sinners and tax collectors, said to His disciples, Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?',
'2:17': 'And when Jesus heard <I>this</I>, He said to them, Those who are strong have no need of a [1]physician, but those who are ill; I did not [a]come to call the [b]righteous, but [2]sinners.',
'2:18': '[1]And the [a]disciples of John and the Pharisees were [b]fasting. And they came and [c]said to Him, [d]Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?',
'2:19': 'And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot fast while the [a]bridegroom is with them, can they? For as long a time as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.',
'2:20': 'But [a]days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.',
'2:21': 'No one sews a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment; otherwise, that which fills it up pulls away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.',
'2:22': 'And no one puts new wine into [a]old wineskins; otherwise, the wine will burst the wineskins, and the wine is ruined as well as the wineskins; but new wine <I>is</I> <I>put</I> into fresh wineskins.',
'2:23': '[1]And He [a]passed through the grainfields on the [b]Sabbath, and His disciples began to go <I>along</I>, picking the [c]ears of grain.',
'2:24': 'And the [1]Pharisees said to Him, Look! Why are they doing on the [a]Sabbath what is [b]not lawful?',
'2:25': 'And He said to them, Have you [a]never read what [1b]David did when he had need and became hungry, he and those with him;',
'2:26': 'How he entered into the house of God during the time of [a]Abiathar the high priest and ate the [b]bread of the Presence, which is not lawful <I>for</I> <I>anyone</I> to [c]eat except the priests, and he gave also to those who were with him?',
'2:27': 'And He said to them, The [a]Sabbath came into being for man, and [1]not man for the [b]Sabbath.',
'2:28': 'So then the [a]Son of Man is [1]Lord even of the Sabbath.',
'3:1': '[1]And He entered again into the synagogue; and there was a [a]man there who had a withered hand.',
'3:2': 'And they were [a]watching Him closely <I>to</I> <I>see</I> if He would heal him on the [b]Sabbath, so that they might [c]accuse Him.',
'3:3': 'And He said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise <I>and</I> <I>stand</I> in the midst.',
'3:4': 'And He said to them, Is it [a]lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to [1]save [2]life or to kill? But they remained silent.',
'3:5': 'And [a]looking around at them with [1]anger and being greatly grieved with the [b]hardness of their heart, He said to the man, [c]Stretch out your hand. And he stretched <I>it</I> out, and his hand was [2]restored.',
'3:6': 'And the [1]Pharisees went out and [a]immediately took [b]counsel with the [c]Herodians against Him <I>as</I> <I>to</I> how they might [d]destroy Him.',
'3:7': 'And Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the [a]sea, and a great multitude from Galilee [b]followed; and from Judea',
'3:8': 'And from Jerusalem and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan and around [a]Tyre and Sidon, a great [b]multitude, hearing what things He did, came to Him.',
'3:9': 'And He told His disciples to have a little [1a]boat ready near Him because of the crowd, so that they would not [b]throng Him;',
'3:10': 'For He [1]healed many, so that as many as had [2a]afflictions [3]pressed toward Him to [b]touch Him.',
'3:11': 'And the [a]unclean spirits, when they beheld Him, fell before Him and [b]cried out, saying, You are the [c]Son of God!',
'3:12': 'And He [1]charged them many times [a]not to make Him known.',
'3:13': 'And He went up to the mountain and [a]called to <I>Him</I> those whom He Himself wanted, and they went to Him.',
'3:14': 'And He [1]appointed [2]twelve, [3]whom He also named apostles, so that they might be with Him and that He might send them to [4]preach',
'3:15': 'And to have the [a]authority to [1]cast out the demons.',
'3:16': '[1]And He appointed the [a]twelve: and to Simon He [2]gave the name [b]Peter;',
'3:17': 'And James the <I>son</I> of [a]Zebedee, and [b]John the brother of James, and He gave them the name, [1]Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder;',
'3:18': 'And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and [a]Matthew, and Thomas, and James the <I>son</I> of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,',
'3:19': 'And [a]Judas Iscariot, who also [1]betrayed Him.',
'3:20': 'And [1]He came into a [a]house, and again a crowd came together, so that they could [2b]not even eat bread.',
'3:21': 'And when His [a]relatives heard about <I>it</I>, they went out to lay hold of Him, for they said, [1]He is [b]beside Himself.',
'3:22': '[1]And the [2]scribes who came down from [a]Jerusalem [b]said, He [c]has [3d]Beelzebul, and by the [4e]ruler of the demons He casts out the demons.',
'3:23': 'And He called them to <I>Himself</I> and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?',
'3:24': 'And if a [1a]kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand;',
'3:25': 'And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand;',
'3:26': 'And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand but has come to an end.',
'3:27': 'But no one can enter into the house of the strong man and thoroughly [a]plunder his [1]goods unless he first [2b]binds the strong man, and then he will thoroughly plunder his house.',
'3:28': 'Truly I say to you that all sins will be [a]forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they [b]blaspheme,',
'3:29': 'But whoever blasphemes against the [1]Holy [a]Spirit has no forgiveness forever, but is guilty of an [2]everlasting sin.',
'3:30': '<I>He</I> <I>said</I> <I>this</I> because they said, He has an unclean spirit.',
'3:31': 'And [a]His [1]mother and His [b]brothers came, and standing outside, [c]they sent <I>word</I> to Him and called Him.',
'3:32': 'And a crowd sat around Him, and they said to Him, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are outside seeking You.',
'3:33': 'And He answered them and said, [1]Who is My mother and My brothers?',
'3:34': 'And [a]looking around at those sitting in a circle around Him, He said, Behold, My mother and My [b]brothers!',
'3:35': 'For whoever [1a]does the will of God, this one is [2]My brother and sister and mother.',
'4:1': '[1]And again He began to [2]teach [a]beside the [b]sea, and a very great crowd was gathered unto Him, so that He stepped into a [c]boat in the sea and sat down, and all the crowd was on the land, facing the sea.',
'4:2': 'And He taught them many things in parables and said to them in His [a]teaching:',
'4:3': 'Listen! Behold, the [1a]sower went out to [2]sow.',
'4:4': 'And as he sowed, some <I>seed</I> fell beside the way, and the birds came and devoured it.',
'4:5': 'And other <I>seed</I> fell on the rocky place, where it did not have much earth, and [a]immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.',
'4:6': 'And when the sun [a]rose, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered.',
'4:7': 'And other <I>seed</I> fell into the [a]thorns, and the thorns came up and utterly choked it, and it yielded no fruit.',
'4:8': 'And others fell into the good earth and yielded fruit, coming up and growing; and one [a]bore thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one a [b]hundredfold.',
'4:9': 'And He said, He who has [a]ears to hear, let him hear.',
'4:10': 'And when He was [a]alone, those around Him, with the twelve, asked Him about the parables.',
'4:11': 'And He said to them, To you it has been given <I>to</I> <I>know</I> the [1a]mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those [b]outside, all things [2]are in [c]parables,',
'4:12': 'In order that [a]seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and [b]not understand, lest they [c]turn and it be forgiven them.',
'4:13': 'And He said to them, Do you not [1]know this [a]parable? And how will you [1]know all the parables?',
'4:14': 'The [a]sower sows the [b]word.',
'4:15': 'And these are the ones beside the way, where the word is sown; and when they hear, [a]immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown into them.',
'4:16': 'And likewise, these are the ones being sown on the rocky places, who, when they [a]hear the word, immediately receive it with joy.',
'4:17': 'Yet they have no root in themselves, but last only [a]for a time; then when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they are [b]stumbled.',
'4:18': 'And others are the ones being sown into the thorns; these are the ones who have heard the word,',
'4:19': 'And the [a]anxieties of the age and the [b]deceitfulness of [c]riches and the lusts for other things enter in and utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.',
'4:20': 'And these are the ones sown on the good earth: <I>those</I> who hear the word and receive <I>it</I> and [a]bear fruit, one thirtyfold, and one sixtyfold, and one a hundredfold.',
'4:21': 'And He said to them, Does the [1a]lamp come so that it may be placed under the [2]bushel or under the bed? <I>Does</I> <I>it</I> not <I>come</I> that it may be placed on the [3]lampstand?',
'4:22': 'For nothing is [a]hidden except that it may be manifested, nor has <I>anything</I> become concealed but that it may come into the open.',
'4:23': 'If anyone has [a]ears to hear, let him hear.',
'4:24': 'And He said to them, Take heed what you hear. [1]With what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you, and it shall be added to you.',
'4:25': 'For he who [1a]has, it shall be given to him; and he who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.',
'4:26': 'And He said, So is the [1a]kingdom of God: as if a [2]man cast [3b]seed on the earth,',
'4:27': 'And [1]sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and [2]lengthens&mdash;how, he does not know.',
'4:28': 'The [1]earth bears fruit [2]by itself: first a blade, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.',
'4:29': 'But when the fruit is ripe, [a]immediately he sends forth the [1b]sickle, because the harvest has come.',
'4:30': '[1]And He said, How shall we liken the [a]kingdom of God, or in what parable shall we [2]present it?',
'4:31': 'It is like a [a]mustard seed, which, when it is sown on the earth, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.',
'4:32': 'And when it is sown, it comes up and becomes [1]greater than all the herbs and produces great branches, so that the [1]birds of heaven can roost under its shade.',
'4:33': 'And in many such [1]parables He spoke the [a]word to them as they were [b]able to hear;',
'4:34': 'And without a [a]parable He did not speak to them; but [b]privately to His own disciples He explained all things.',
'4:35': 'And He said to them on that day when evening had fallen, Let us [a]go over to the other side.',
'4:36': '[1]And leaving the crowd, they took Him along, just as He was, in the [a]boat; and other boats were with Him.',
'4:37': 'And there arose a great [a]windstorm, and the waves beat into the [b]boat, so that the boat was already beginning to fill up.',
'4:38': 'And He was in the stern, [1]sleeping on the cushion. And they woke Him and said to Him, Teacher, does it not matter to You that we are perishing?',
'4:39': 'And having awoken, He [1a]rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Be silent! Be still! And the wind [b]ceased and there was a [c]great calm.',
'4:40': 'And He said to them, Why are you [a]cowardly in this way? How <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>that</I> you do not have [b]faith?',
'4:41': 'And they became greatly frightened and said to one another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea [1a]obey Him?',
'5:1': '[1]And they came to the other [a]side of the sea, into the region of the [b]Gerasenes.',
'5:2': 'And when He came out of the boat, [a]immediately, from out of the tombs, a man with an [b]unclean spirit met Him,',
'5:3': 'Who had his dwelling among the [1]tombs. And no one could bind him any longer, not even with a chain,',
'5:4': 'Because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles smashed, and no one was strong enough to subdue him.',
'5:5': 'And continually night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he cried out and gashed himself with stones.',
'5:6': 'And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and [a]worshipped Him,',
'5:7': 'And crying out with a [a]loud voice, [1]he said, [2]What do I have to do [b]with You, Jesus, Son of the [c]Most High God? I [d]adjure You by God, do not torment me!',
'5:8': 'For He had said to him, Come out of the man, unclean [1]spirit.',
'5:9': 'And He questioned him, What is your name? And he said to Him, [a]Legion is my name, because we are many.',
'5:10': 'And he entreated Him much not to send them out of the region.',
'5:11': 'Now there on the mountainside was a great herd of hogs feeding.',
'5:12': 'And [1]they entreated Him, saying, Send us to the hogs, so that we may enter into them.',
'5:13': 'And [1]He gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the hogs, and the herd, about two thousand, rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.',
'5:14': 'And those who were feeding them fled and reported <I>it</I> in the city and in the countryside. And they came to see what had happened.',
'5:15': 'And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting down, clothed, and sane, the man who had had the [a]legion, and they became frightened.',
'5:16': 'And those who had seen <I>it</I> related to them how it had happened to the demon-possessed man and concerning the hogs.',
'5:17': 'And they began to entreat Him to [a]depart from their borders.',
'5:18': 'And as He got into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might stay with Him.',
'5:19': 'And He did not allow him, but said to him, Go to your house, to your own <I>people</I>, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and <I>how</I> He has had mercy on you.',
'5:20': 'And he departed and began to proclaim in [1a]Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him, and all marveled.',
'5:21': 'And when Jesus had [a]crossed over again in the boat to the other [b]side, a great crowd gathered to Him, and He was beside the sea.',
'5:22': '[1]And [a]one of the [b]rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name, and seeing Him, fell at His feet;',
'5:23': 'And he entreated Him much, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and [a]lay Your hands on her that she may be [1]healed and live.',
'5:24': 'And He went with him, and a great crowd followed Him and [a]pressed upon Him.',
'5:25': 'And a [1]woman <I>was</I> <I>there</I>, who had a [a]flow of blood for [b]twelve years.',
'5:26': 'She had suffered much under many physicians and had spent everything she had and had not benefited at all, but rather became worse.',
'5:27': 'When she heard the things concerning Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind <I>Him</I> and [a]touched His garment,',
'5:28': 'For she said, If I touch even His garments, I will be [1]healed.',
'5:29': 'And [a]immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured of the [b]affliction.',
'5:30': 'And immediately Jesus, realizing in Himself that [1a]power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, Who [b]touched My garments?',
'5:31': 'And His disciples said to Him, You see the crowd [1a]pressing upon You and You say, Who touched Me?',
'5:32': 'And He looked around to see her who had done this.',
'5:33': 'But the woman, [1]frightened and trembling, knew what had happened to her, and she came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.',
'5:34': 'And He said to her, [1]Daughter, your [a]faith has [2]healed you. Go [3]in [b]peace and be [4]well from your affliction.',
'5:35': 'While He was still speaking, <I>some</I> came from <I>the</I> <I>house</I> <I>of</I> the [a]ruler of the synagogue, saying, Your daughter has died. Why [b]bother the Teacher any longer?',
'5:36': 'But Jesus, [1]overhearing the word spoken, said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not be afraid&mdash;only believe.',
'5:37': 'And He did not allow anyone to accompany Him except [a]Peter and James and [b]John the brother of James.',
'5:38': 'And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and He saw a commotion and <I>people</I> weeping and wailing greatly.',
'5:39': 'And He entered in and said to them, Why do you make a commotion and weep? The child has not died but is [a]sleeping.',
'5:40': 'And they laughed scornfully at Him. But He, [a]putting <I>them</I> all out, took the father of the child and the mother and those with Him and went in to where the child was.',
'5:41': 'And He [a]took hold of the child&rsquo;s hand and said to her, [1]Talitha koum! which being interpreted is, Little girl, to you I say, [b]Arise!',
'5:42': 'And [a]immediately the little girl rose up and walked about, for she was [b]twelve years old. And immediately, they were [c]amazed with great amazement.',
'5:43': 'And He strongly commanded them that [1a]no one should know about this, and told <I>them</I> to give her <I>something</I> to eat.',
'6:1': 'And He went out from there and [a]came into His own country, and His disciples followed Him.',
'6:2': 'And when the Sabbath had come, He began to [1]teach in the [a]synagogue; and many hearing were [b]astounded, saying, Where <I>did</I> this man <I>get</I> these things? And what is this wisdom given to this man, and <I>how</I> <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>that</I> such works of power take place through His hands?',
'6:3': 'Is not this the [1]carpenter, the son of Mary, and [a]brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us? And they were [b]stumbled because of Him.',
'6:4': 'And Jesus said to them, A [a]prophet is not without honor except in his <I>own</I> country and among his <I>own</I> relatives and in his <I>own</I> house.',
'6:5': 'And He could [1]not do any work of power there, except to [a]lay His hands upon a few <I>of</I> <I>the</I> sick and [2]heal <I>them</I>.',
'6:6': 'And He [a]marveled because of their unbelief; and He went around the [b]villages in a circuit, teaching.',
'6:7': 'And He [a]called the twelve to <I>Him</I> and began to send them out two by two and gave them [1b]authority over the unclean spirits;',

'6:9': 'But <I>to</I> <I>have</I> sandals tied on; and <I>said</I>, Do not put on two [1]tunics.',

'6:13': 'And they [1]cast out many demons and [a]anointed many <I>of</I> <I>the</I> sick with oil and healed <I>them</I>.',
'6:14': 'And King Herod [a]heard <I>of</I> <I>it</I>, for His name had become known, and they said, [b]John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this these works of power [1]are operating through him.',
'6:15': 'But others said, He is [a]Elijah; and others said, <I>He</I> <I>is</I> a [b]prophet, like one of the prophets.',
'6:16': 'But Herod, hearing <I>of</I> <I>it</I>, said, He whom I [a]beheaded, John, this one was raised!',
'6:17': 'For Herod himself had sent <I>men</I> and seized John and bound him in [a]prison on account of [b]Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.',
'6:18': 'For John had been saying to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have the wife of your [a]brother.',
'6:19': 'Thus, Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to kill him and could not,',
'6:20': 'For Herod feared [a]John, knowing that he was a [b]righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. And when he heard him, he was very perplexed yet [c]heard him gladly.',
'6:21': 'And an opportune day came, when Herod on his [a]birthday made a [b]banquet for his courtiers and the commanders and the leading men of Galilee.',
'6:22': 'And when the daughter of Herodias herself entered and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining <I>at</I> <I>table</I> with <I>him</I>. The king said to the girl, Ask of me whatever you want, and I will give <I>it</I> to you.',
'6:23': 'And he swore to her earnestly, Whatever you ask of me, I will give to you, up to [a]half of my kingdom.',
'6:24': 'And she went out and said to her mother, What should I ask for? And she said, The head of John the baptizer.',
'6:25': 'And coming in [a]immediately with haste to the king, she asked, saying, I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.',
'6:26': 'And the king was very grieved, yet because of the oaths and those reclining <I>at</I> <I>table</I>, he did not want to refuse her.',
'6:27': 'And [a]immediately the king sent a guard and ordered <I>him</I> to bring his head. And he went out and [1b]beheaded him in the prison,',
'6:28': 'And brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.',
'6:29': 'And when his [a]disciples heard <I>about</I> <I>it</I>, they came and took his corpse and put it in a tomb.',
'6:30': 'And the [a]apostles gathered together to Jesus and [b]reported to Him all that they did and <I>all</I> that they taught.',
'6:31': 'And He said to them, Come by yourselves privately to a [a]deserted place and rest a while. For there were many coming and going, and they did [1]not even have opportunity to [b]eat.',
'6:32': '[1]And they [a]went away in the boat to a deserted place privately.',

'6:34': 'And getting out, He saw a great crowd, and He was [1]moved with [a]compassion for them because they were like sheep not having a shepherd, and He began to teach them many things.',

'6:37': 'But He answered and said to them, You [a]give them <I>something</I> to eat. And they said to Him, Shall we go away and buy two hundred [1]denarii worth of bread and give <I>it</I> to them to eat?',
'6:38': 'And He said to them, [a]How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they found out, they said, Five, and two fish.',
'6:39': 'And He ordered them to have all recline [1]by companies on the green grass.',
'6:40': 'And they sat down [1]in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.',
'6:41': 'And He took the five loaves and the two fish and, [a]looking up to heaven, He [b]blessed and broke the loaves and gave <I>them</I> to the disciples to set before them; and the two fish He divided among all.',
'6:42': 'And they all ate and were satisfied.',
'6:43': 'And they took up [1]twelve full handbaskets of the broken pieces <I>of</I> <I>bread</I> and of the fish.',
'6:44': 'And those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.',

'6:49': 'But when they saw Him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out,',
'6:50': 'For they all saw Him and were [a]startled. But [b]immediately He spoke with them and said to them, Take [c]courage. [1]It is I. Do not be [d]afraid.',
'6:51': 'And He went up unto them into the boat, and the wind [a]ceased. And they were greatly [b]astonished in themselves beyond measure,',
'6:52': 'For they did not [a]understand concerning the loaves, but rather their heart was hardened.',
'6:53': 'And they [a]crossed over to the land and came to [b]Gennesaret and moored <I>there</I>.',
'6:54': 'And when they came out of the boat, [a]immediately <I>the</I> <I>people</I> [b]recognized Him,',

'6:56': 'And wherever He entered into [a]villages or into cities or into the countryside, they laid those who were sick in the [b]marketplaces and begged Him that they might touch if even the [1]fringe of His garment; and as many as [c]touched Him were [2]healed.',
'7:1': '[1]And the [a]Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to Him when they had come from [b]Jerusalem',

'7:5': 'And the [1]Pharisees and the scribes questioned Him, Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with common hands?',
'7:6': 'And He said to them, Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you [1]hypocrites, as it is written, [a]&ldquo;This people honors Me with their [b]lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;',

'7:19': 'Because it does not enter into his heart, but into the [a]stomach, and goes out into the drain? (In saying this, He made all foods [b]clean.)',

'14:1': '[1]Now the [a]Passover and the <I>Feast</I> <I>of</I> [b]Unleavened Bread were [c]two days away. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to [d]seize Him by craftiness and [e]kill <I>Him</I>,',
'14:2': 'For they said, Not at the feast, lest there be a [a]tumult by the people.',
'14:3': '[1]And while He was in [a]Bethany in the [b]house of Simon the [c]leper, as He reclined <I>at</I> <I>table</I>, a woman came, having an alabaster flask of ointment, of very costly pure nard, and she broke the alabaster flask and poured <I>it</I> over His head.',
'14:4': 'But there were some who were indignantly commenting among themselves: Why has this waste of the ointment [1]been made?',
'14:5': 'For this ointment could have been sold for over [a]three hundred [1]denarii and given to the [b]poor. And they were infuriated with her.',
'14:6': 'But Jesus said, Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a noble deed on Me.',
'14:7': 'For you always have the [a]poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you do not always have [1]Me.',
'14:8': '[1]She has done what she could; she has [2]anointed My body beforehand for the [a]burial.',
'14:9': 'And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is [1]proclaimed in the whole [a]world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a [b]memorial of her.',
'14:10': 'And [a]Judas Iscariot, one of the [b]twelve, went off to the chief priests to [c]deliver Him up to them.',
'14:11': 'And when they heard <I>this</I>, they rejoiced and promised to give him [1]money. And he sought a way to [2]deliver Him up opportunely.',
'14:12': 'And on the first day of the [1]<I>Feast</I> <I>of</I> [a]Unleavened Bread, when they [2]sacrificed the [b]passover, His disciples said to Him, Where do You want us to go and prepare so that You may eat the passover?',
'14:13': 'And He [a]sent two of His disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you; follow him;',
'14:14': 'And wherever he enters, say to the [1]master of the house, The [a]Teacher says, Where is My guest room, where I may eat the [b]passover with My disciples?',
'14:15': 'And he will show you a large [a]upper room, furnished <I>and</I> ready. And there prepare for us.',
'14:16': 'And the disciples went out and came into the city and found <I>it</I> even as He had told them, and they prepared the passover.',
'14:17': 'And when [a]evening fell, He came with the twelve.',
'14:18': 'And as they were reclining <I>at</I> <I>table</I> and [1]eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you that [2]one of you will [a]betray Me, one who is [b]eating with Me.',
'14:19': 'They began to be grieved and to say to Him one by one, Surely not I? [1]',
'14:20': 'And He said to them, It will be one of the twelve, [1]one who dips with Me in the dish.',
'14:21': 'For the Son of Man is [1]going away, even as it is [a]written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.',
'14:22': '[1]And as they were [2]eating, He took [a]bread and [b]blessed <I>it</I>, and He broke <I>it</I> and gave <I>it</I> to them, and said, Take; this is My [c]body.',
'14:23': 'And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave <I>it</I> to them; and they all drank of it.',
'14:24': 'And He said to them, This is My [a]blood of the [1]covenant, which is being poured out for [b]many.',
'14:25': 'Truly I say to you, I shall by no means drink of the [1]product of the vine anymore until that day when I drink it new in the [a]kingdom of God.',
'14:26': 'And after [a]singing a hymn, they went out to the [b]Mount of Olives.',
'14:27': 'And Jesus said to them, You will all be [a]stumbled[1], because it is written, &ldquo;I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep will be [b]scattered.&rdquo;',
'14:28': 'But after I have been raised, I will go before you into [a]Galilee.',
'14:29': 'But Peter said to Him, Even if all will be stumbled, yet I will not!',
'14:30': 'And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that today in this night, before a [a]rooster crows twice, you will [1]deny Me three times.',
'14:31': 'But he went on speaking more intensely, <I>Even</I> if I must [a]die with You, I will by no means deny You! And they all said similarly.',
'14:32': '[1]And they came to a place named Gethsemane, and He [a]said to His disciples, Sit here while I pray.',
'14:33': 'And He took [a]Peter and James and John with Him and began to be [1]awestruck and deeply distressed.',
'14:34': 'And He said to them, My soul is exceedingly [a]sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and [b]watch.',
'14:35': 'And going forward a little, He fell on the ground and [a]prayed that, if it were possible, the [1b]hour would pass from Him.',
'14:36': 'And He said, [a]Abba Father, all things are [b]possible to You; remove this [c]cup from Me; yet not what I [d]will, but what [1]You <I>will</I>.',
'14:37': 'And He came and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, Simon, are you sleeping? Were you not able to watch for one hour?',
'14:38': '[a]Watch and [b]pray that you may not come into [c]temptation. The [d]spirit is willing, but the [e]flesh is weak.',
'14:39': 'And going away again, He prayed, saying the same thing.',
'14:40': 'And coming again, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy. And they did [a]not know what to answer Him.',
'14:41': 'And He came the third time and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough. The [a]hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being [b]delivered into the hands of sinners.',
'14:42': 'Arise, let us be going. Behold, the one betraying Me has drawn near.',
'14:43': 'And [a]immediately, while He was still [b]speaking, [c]Judas, one of the twelve, appeared, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.',
'14:44': 'Now the one who was [a]betraying Him had given them a signal, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the one. Seize Him and lead <I>Him</I> away securely.',
'14:45': 'And when he came, he [a]immediately approached Him and said, [b]Rabbi! and [c]kissed Him affectionately.',
'14:46': 'And they laid hands on Him and [a]seized Him.',
'14:47': 'But a certain [1]one of those standing by drew his [a]sword and struck the slave of the high priest, and took off his ear.',
'14:48': 'And Jesus answered and said to them, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest Me?',
'14:49': 'Day after day I was with you in the [1]temple [2a]teaching and you did not seize Me. But may the [b]Scriptures be [c]fulfilled.',
'14:50': 'And they all [a]left Him and fled.',
'14:51': 'And a certain young man was accompanying Him, clothed with a linen cloth over <I>his</I> naked body; and they seized him.',
'14:52': 'But he left the linen cloth behind and fled naked.',
'14:53': '[1]And they [2a]led Jesus away to the high priest, and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together.',
'14:54': 'And Peter [a]followed Him at a distance until <I>he</I> <I>was</I> within the [b]courtyard of the high priest. And he was <I>there</I> sitting with the [c]attendants and warming himself in the light <I>of</I> <I>the</I> <I>fire</I>.',
'14:55': 'Now the chief priests and the whole [1a]Sanhedrin were seeking testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death, and they could not find <I>it</I>.',
'14:56': 'For many gave [a]false testimony against Him, yet the testimonies were not consistent.',
'14:57': 'And [a]some stood up and testified falsely against Him, saying,',
'14:58': 'We heard Him say, I will [a]destroy this temple made with [b]hands, and [1]in three days I will build another made without hands.',
'14:59': 'And neither in this regard was their testimony consistent.',
'14:60': 'And the high priest stood up in the midst and questioned Jesus, saying, Do You not answer anything? What <I>is</I> <I>this</I> <I>that</I> these testify against You?',
'14:61': 'But He was silent and did not answer [a]anything. Again the high priest questioned Him and said to Him, Are [b]You the [c]Christ, the Son of the [1d]Blessed?',
'14:62': 'And Jesus said, [1]I am. And you shall see the [a]Son of Man sitting at the [b]right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.',
'14:63': 'And the high priest, [a]tearing his [1]garments, said, What further need do we have of witnesses?',
'14:64': 'You heard the [1a]blasphemy! How does it appear to you? And they all condemned Him as being worthy of [b]death.',
'14:65': 'And some began to [1a]spit at Him and to [b]blindfold His face and to [c]beat Him with their fists and to say to Him, [2]Prophesy! And the attendants, [3d]slapping <I>Him</I> about, took Him.',
'14:66': '[1]And while Peter was below in the [a]courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,',
'14:67': 'And seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, You also were with the [a]Nazarene, Jesus.',
'14:68': 'But he denied <I>it</I>, saying, I neither know nor understand what you are talking about. And he went outside into the forecourt, and a rooster crowed.',
'14:69': 'And the servant girl, seeing him, began again to say to those standing by, This man is <I>one</I> of them!',
'14:70': 'But again he denied <I>it</I>. And after a little while, those standing by again said to Peter, Surely you are <I>one</I> of them, for you are a [a]Galilean as well[1].',
'14:71': 'But he began to [1]curse and to swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak!',
'14:72': 'And [a]immediately a [b]rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered the word, how Jesus had said to him, Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times. And thinking upon it, he wept.',
'15:1': 'And [a]immediately in the morning the [b]chief priests held a [c]consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole [1]Sanhedrin, and having bound Jesus, they led <I>Him</I> away and [d]delivered <I>Him</I> to [2e]Pilate.',
'15:2': 'And Pilate [a]questioned Him, Are You the [b]King of the Jews? And answering him, He said, It is as you say.',
'15:3': 'And the chief priests [a]accused Him of many things.',
'15:4': 'And Pilate again questioned Him, saying, Do You answer nothing? See how many things they are accusing You of.',
'15:5': 'But Jesus made [1a]no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.',
'15:6': 'Now at the [a]feasts he released to them one prisoner whom they requested.',
'15:7': 'And there was one named Barabbas, bound with the [a]insurrectionists who had committed [b]murder in the insurrection.',
'15:8': 'And the crowd [1]came up and began to ask <I>him</I> <I>to</I> <I>do</I> even as he had been accustomed to do for them.',
'15:9': 'But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the [a]King of the Jews?',
'15:10': 'For he knew that <I>it</I> <I>was</I> because of envy <I>that</I> the chief priests had delivered Him up.',
'15:11': 'But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that instead he should [a]release Barabbas to them.',
'15:12': 'And Pilate again answered and said to them, What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?',
'15:13': 'And again they cried out, [1a]Crucify Him!',
'15:14': 'But Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, Crucify Him!',
'15:15': 'And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released to them Barabbas and [1a]scourged Jesus and delivered <I>Him</I> up to be [2]crucified.',
'15:16': '[1]And the [a]soldiers led Him away within the courtyard, that is, the [2b]praetorium, and called together the whole [c]cohort.',
'15:17': 'And they clothed Him in [1a]purple and wove a [b]thorny crown and put it [2]around His <I>head</I>.',
'15:18': 'And they began to salute Him: [1]Rejoice, [a]King of the Jews!',
'15:19': 'And they beat His head with a reed and [a]spat at Him. And kneeling down, they bowed before Him.',
'15:20': 'And when they had [a]mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple and put His garments on Him. And they [b]led Him out to crucify Him.',
'15:21': '[1]And they [a]compelled a certain passerby coming from the country, [b]Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and [c]Rufus, to take up His cross.',
'15:22': 'And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is interpreted, the [a]Place of a Skull.',
'15:23': 'And they [1]tried to give Him wine mixed with [a]myrrh, but He did not take <I>it</I>.',
'15:24': 'And they crucified Him and divided His garments, casting [a]lots for them <I>to</I> <I>see</I> what each should take.',
'15:25': 'Now it was the [1a]third hour and they crucified Him.',
'15:26': 'And there was an inscription of the charge against Him inscribed: THE [a]KING OF THE JEWS.',
'15:27': 'And with Him they crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left.',
'15:28': '[1]And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, [a]&ldquo;And He was counted with the lawless.&rdquo;',
'15:29': 'And those who were passing by [a]blasphemed Him, [b]wagging their heads and saying, [c]Aha! [1]You who [d]destroy the temple and build <I>it</I> in three days,',
'15:30': '[1]Save Yourself and come down from the cross!',
'15:31': 'Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes [a]mocked <I>Him</I> with one another and said, He saved others; [b]Himself He cannot save.',
'15:32': 'Let the Christ, the [a]King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with Him also [b]reproached Him.',
'15:33': 'And when the [1]sixth hour came, [a]darkness fell over the whole land until the [2]ninth hour.',
'15:34': 'And at the ninth hour Jesus [a]cried with a [b]loud voice, [1]Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is interpreted, [c]My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?',
'15:35': 'And some of those standing by heard <I>this</I> and said, Behold, He is calling for Elijah.',
'15:36': 'And someone ran and filled a sponge with [a]vinegar, and putting <I>it</I> on a reed, gave <I>it</I> to Him to drink, saying, Let <I>Him</I> be. Let us see if Elijah is coming to take Him down.',
'15:37': 'And Jesus let out a [a]loud cry and expired.',
'15:38': 'And the [a]veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom.',
'15:39': 'And the [a]centurion standing by opposite Him, seeing that He expired in this way, said, Truly this man was the [b]Son of God.',
'15:40': 'And there were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary the [a]Magdalene, and [1]Mary the <I>mother</I> of the [2]younger James and of Joses, and [3]Salome,',
'15:41': 'Who, when He was in Galilee, followed Him and [a]ministered to Him, as well as many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.',
'15:42': 'And when [1]evening had fallen, since it was <I>the</I> <I>day</I> <I>of</I> [a]preparation, that is, the <I>day</I> before the Sabbath,',
'15:43': '[a]Joseph, [1]the honorable member of the Council, from Arimathea, who was also himself [b]awaiting the [c]kingdom of God, came; and gathering courage, he went in to [d]Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.',
'15:44': 'And Pilate marveled that He had already died, and calling to <I>him</I> the [a]centurion, he questioned him whether He had been dead long.',
'15:45': 'And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.',
'15:46': 'And <I>Joseph</I> purchased a piece of fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped <I>Him</I> in the fine linen. And he [1]laid Him in a [a]tomb which was hewn out of rock and rolled a stone against the [b]door of the tomb.',
'15:47': 'And Mary the [a]Magdalene and Mary the <I>mother</I> of Joses saw where He was laid.',
'16:1': '[1]And when the [a]Sabbath was past, Mary the [b]Magdalene, and [2]Mary the <I>mother</I> of James, and [3]Salome bought [c]spices so that they might come and [4]anoint Him.',
'16:2': 'And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the [a]tomb as the sun rose.',
'16:3': 'And they said to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?',
'16:4': 'And when they looked up, they saw that the [a]stone had been rolled away, for it was extremely large.',
'16:5': 'And when they entered into the tomb, they saw [a]a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were [b]alarmed.',
'16:6': 'And he said to them, Do not be alarmed. You are seeking Jesus the [a]Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has been [1]raised; He is not here. Behold the place where they laid Him.',
'16:7': 'But go, tell His disciples [1]and Peter that He is going before you into [a]Galilee. There you will see Him, even as He told you.',
'16:8': 'And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.',
'16:9': '[1]Now after He had risen early on the first day of the week, He [a]appeared first to Mary the [b]Magdalene, from whom He had [2]cast out [c]seven demons.',
'16:10': 'She went and [a]reported to those who had been with Him, <I>who</I> <I>were</I> mourning and [b]weeping.',
'16:11': 'And when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did [a]not believe.',
'16:12': 'And after these things, He [a]appeared in a different form to [b]two of them as they were walking on their way into the countryside.',
'16:13': 'And they went away and reported to the rest, but they did not believe them either.',
'16:14': 'And afterward He [a]appeared to the eleven as they were reclining <I>at</I> <I>table</I>, and He reproached their unbelief and [b]hardness of heart, because they did [c]not believe those who had seen Him after He had risen.',
'16:15': 'And He said to them, Go into all the [a]world and [1]proclaim the gospel to [2b]all the creation.',
'16:16': 'He who [1a]believes and is [b]baptized shall be [c]saved, but he who does [2d]not believe shall be condemned.',
'16:17': 'And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My [a]name they will cast out demons; they will [1]speak with new [b]tongues;',
'16:18': 'They will pick up [a]serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will [b]lay hands on the sick, and they will be [c]well.',
'16:19': 'So then the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them, was [1]taken up into [a]heaven and sat at the [b]right hand of God.',
'16:20': 'And they went out and [1]preached everywhere, the Lord working with <I>them</I> and confirming the word by the accompanying [a]signs.',

{sup:1, word:"beginning", lines:["The writer of this Gospel was Mark, also called John ({Act12:25|Acts 12:25}), the son of one of the Marys (who was close to the apostle Peter in the church at Jerusalem&mdash;{Act12:12|Acts 12:12}) and the cousin of Barnabas ({Col4:10|Col. 4:10}). He accompanied Barnabas and Saul in their ministry ({Act12:25|Acts 12:25}) and joined Paul in the first journey of his ministry to the Gentiles; but he left Paul and turned back at Perga ({Act13:13|Acts 13:13}). Because of his turning back, Paul refused to take him on his second journey. At that time Barnabas separated himself from Paul, and Mark then joined Barnabas in his work ({Act15:36|Acts 15:36}-{Act15:40|40}). However, Mark was close to Paul in Paul&rsquo;s later years ({Col4:10|Col. 4:10}; {Phm1:24|Philem. 24}) and was useful to him for his ministry until Paul&rsquo;s martyrdom ({2Ti4:11|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:11}). He was close to Peter and was probably with him continually, as seen in the fact that Peter considered him his son ({1Pe5:13|1&nbsp;Pet. 5:13}). From the early days of the church his Gospel has been considered a written account of the oral presentation of Peter, who accompanied the Savior in His gospel service from its beginning (vv. {Mrk1:16|16}-{Mrk1:18|18}) to its end ({Mrk14:54|14:54}, {Mrk14:66|66}-{Mrk14:72|72}). Mark&rsquo;s record is according to historical sequence and gives more details concerning the historical facts than the other Gospels. The entire Gospel is summarized in Peter&rsquo;s word in {Act10:36|Acts 10:36}-{Act10:42|42}.","John presents the God-Savior, emphasizing the Savior&rsquo;s deity in His humanity. Matthew presents the King-Savior; Mark, the Slave-Savior; and Luke, the Man-Savior. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are synoptic in portraying the Savior&rsquo;s humanity in different aspects, with His deity. Since Mark presents the Savior as a slave, he does not tell His genealogy and status, because the ancestry of a slave is not worthy of note. Furthermore, in contrast to Matthew, who presents to us the Savior&rsquo;s marvelous teachings and parables concerning the heavenly kingdom, and John, who presents His profound revelations of divine truths, Mark&rsquo;s intention is not to impress us with the Slave&rsquo;s wonderful words but with His excellent deeds in His gospel service. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel provides more detail than the other Gospels in order to portray the Slave-Savior&rsquo;s diligence, faithfulness, and other virtues in the saving service He rendered to sinners for God. In Mark&rsquo;s Gospel are the fulfillment of the prophecies in {Isa42:1|Isa. 42:1}-{Isa42:4|4}, {Isa42:6|6}-{Isa42:7|7}; {Isa49:5|49:5}-{Isa49:7|7}; {Isa50:4|50:4}-{Isa50:7|7}; {Isa52:13|52:13}&mdash;{Isa53:12|53:12} concerning Christ as the Slave of Jehovah, and the details of the teaching in {Phi2:5|Phil. 2:5}-{Phi2:11|11} regarding Christ as the Slave of God. His diligence in labor, His need of food and rest ({Mrk3:20|3:20}-{Mrk3:21|21}; {Mrk6:31|6:31}), His anger ({Mrk3:5|3:5}), His groaning ({Mrk7:34|7:34}), and His affection ({Mrk10:21|10:21}) display beautifully His humanity in its virtue and perfection, while His lordship ({Mrk2:28|2:28}), His omniscience ({Mrk2:8|2:8}), His miraculous power, and His authority to cast out demons ({Mrk1:27|v. 27}; {Mrk3:15|3:15}), to forgive sins ({Mrk2:7|2:7}, {Mrk2:10|10}), and to silence the wind and the sea ({Mrk4:39|4:39}) manifest in full His deity in its glory and honor. What a Slave of God! How lovely and admirable!

John buried the repenting people in the death water; the Slave-Savior raised them up that they might be regenerated in the Spirit of His resurrection life. The death water, pointing to and signifying the all-inclusive death of Christ, into which His believers are baptized ({Rom6:3|Rom. 6:3}), buried not only the baptized people but also their sins, the world, and their past life and history (just as the Red Sea buried Pharaoh and the Egyptian army for the children of Israel&mdash;{Exo14:26|Exo. 14:26}-{Exo14:28|28}; {1Co10:2|1&nbsp;Cor. 10:2}) and separated them from the God-forsaking world and its corruption (just as the flood did for Noah and his family&mdash;{1Pe3:20|1&nbsp;Pet. 3:20}-{1Pe3:21|21}).

The scribes considered this to be against the theology of their religion (vv. {Mrk2:1|1}-{Mrk2:12|12}).","(2) As a Physician to the sick and miserable people, He feasted with the tax collectors, who were disloyal and unfaithful to their race, and with sinners, who were despised and isolated from society, that they might taste the mercy of God and be recovered to the enjoyment of God. This was condemned by the self-righteous yet merciless scribes of the Pharisees (vv. {Mrk2:13|13}-{Mrk2:17|17}).","(3) As a Bridegroom with the sons of the bridechamber, He caused His followers to be merry and happy without fasting. Thus He annulled the practice of the disciples of John (the new religionists) and the Pharisees (the old religionists) so that His followers could be delivered from the practices of their religion into the enjoyment of God&rsquo;s Christ as their Bridegroom, with His righteousness as their outer clothing and His life as their inner wine in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (vv. {Mrk2:18|18}-{Mrk2:22|22}).","(4) He allowed His followers to pick the ears of grain in the grainfields on the Sabbath so that they could satisfy their hunger. Thus, apparently they broke God&rsquo;s commandment concerning the Sabbath, but actually they pleased God because the hunger of Christ&rsquo;s followers was satisfied through Him, as the hunger of David and his followers had been satisfied with the bread of the Presence in the house of God. This indicates that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, it is a matter not of keeping the regulation of religion but of enjoying satisfaction in and through Christ as the real Sabbath rest (vv. {Mrk2:23|23}-{Mrk2:28|28}).","(5) On the Sabbath He healed a man who had a withered hand, caring not for the keeping of the Sabbath but for the health of His sheep.
