verses: {
'1:1': '[1]James, a [a]slave of God and of the [2]Lord Jesus Christ, to the [3]twelve [b]tribes in the [4c]dispersion: [5]Rejoice!',
'1:2': 'Count <I>it</I> all [a]joy, my [b]brothers, whenever you fall into various [1c]trials,',
'1:3': 'Knowing that the [a]proving of your [1]faith works out [b]endurance.',
'1:4': 'And let [a]endurance have <I>its</I> perfect work that you may be [1b]perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.',
'1:5': 'But if any one of you lacks [1a]wisdom, let him [2b]ask of God, who gives to all [3]liberally and does [4]not reproach, and it will be given to him.',
'1:6': 'But let him ask in [a]faith, [1b]doubting nothing, for he who [1]doubts is like the surge of the [c]sea, driven by the [d]wind and tossed about.',
'1:7': 'For that man must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;',
'1:8': '<I>He</I> <I>is</I> a [1a]double-souled man, unstable in all his ways.',
'1:9': 'And let the lowly brother [1]boast in his [2a]exaltation,',
'1:10': 'And the [1]rich in his being brought low, because like a [a]flower of the grass he will [b]pass away.',
'1:11': 'For the [1]sun rises with its [2]scorching heat and withers the [a]grass, and its flower falls off, and the [b]beauty of its appearance is destroyed; so also the [3c]rich man will fade away in his pursuits.',
'1:12': '[a]Blessed is the man who endures [1]trial, because when he has become [2]approved by testing, he will receive the [3b]crown of [4]life, which He [c]promised to those who [5d]love Him.',
'1:13': 'Let no one say when he is [1a]tempted, I am tempted [2]of God; for God [3]cannot be tempted of evil, and He Himself [4]tempts no one.',
'1:14': 'But each one is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own [a]lusts;',
'1:15': 'Then the lust, having conceived, [1]gives birth to sin; and the sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth [a]death.',
'1:16': 'Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.',
'1:17': 'All good [1]giving and every perfect [1a]gift is from [b]above, coming down from the [2]Father of lights, with whom is no [3c]variation or shadow cast by turning.',
'1:18': 'He [1a]brought us forth by the [2]word of [b]truth, [3]purposing that we might be a kind of [4c]firstfruits of His creatures.',
'1:19': '[1]You know <I>this</I>, my beloved brothers; but let every man be quick to hear, [2]slow to [a]speak, slow to [b]wrath;',
'1:20': 'For the [1]wrath of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God.',
'1:21': 'Therefore [a]putting away all [b]filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in [c]meekness the [1]implanted [d]word, which is able to [2]save your souls.',
'1:22': 'And become [a]doers of the word and not [b]hearers only, who [c]delude themselves.',
'1:23': 'Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a [a]doer, this one is like a man considering in a [b]mirror the face he was born with;',
'1:24': 'For he considers himself and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of person he is.',
'1:25': 'But he who [1]looks into the [2]perfect law, the [a]<I>law</I> of [b]freedom, and continues in <I>it</I>, becoming not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be [c]blessed in his doing.',
'1:26': 'If anyone thinks himself to be [1]religious <I>and</I> <I>yet</I> does [2]not bridle his [a]tongue but [b]deceives his heart, this one&rsquo;s [1]religion is vain.',
'1:27': 'This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit [1a]orphans and widows in their affliction <I>and</I> to keep oneself [2]unspotted from the [3]world.',
'2:1': 'My [a]brothers, do not hold the [1b]faith of our Lord Jesus Christ [2]of [c]glory with [d]respect of persons.',
'2:2': 'For if there comes into your [1]synagogue a man with [a]gold rings in splendid clothing, and there also comes in a [b]poor man in filthy clothing,',
'2:3': 'And you look upon the one wearing the splendid clothing and say, You sit here in a good place, and to the poor man you say, You stand there, or sit under my footstool;',
'2:4': 'Have you not made [1a]distinctions [2]among yourselves and become judges with evil reasonings?',
'2:5': 'Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God [a]choose the poor [1]in the world <I>to</I> <I>be</I> [b]rich in faith and heirs of the [2c]kingdom, which He [d]promised to those who [3e]love Him?',
'2:6': 'But you have [a]dishonored the poor. Is it not the [b]rich <I>who</I> oppress you and <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>not</I> they <I>who</I> [c]drag you to the [1]courts?',
'2:7': 'Is it not they <I>who</I> blaspheme the [1]honorable [a]name [2]by which you are called?',
'2:8': 'If indeed you are fulfilling the [1]royal law according to the Scripture, &ldquo;You shall [2a]love your neighbor as yourself,&rdquo; you do well;',
'2:9': 'But if you [a]respect persons, you [1]commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.',
'2:10': 'For whoever [1]keeps the whole [a]law yet stumbles in [b]one <I>point</I> has become guilty of all.',
'2:11': 'For He who said, Do not commit [a]adultery, also said, Do not murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.',
'2:12': '[1]So speak and so do as those who are to be [a]judged by the [2b]law of freedom.',
'2:13': 'For the judgment is without [a]mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy [1]triumphs over judgment.',
'2:14': 'What is the profit, my brothers, if anyone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith [1]save him?',
'2:15': 'If a brother or sister [1]is [a]without clothing and lacks daily food,',
'2:16': 'And any one of you says to them, [1]Go in peace, be warmed and filled, yet you do [a]not give them the [2]necessities of the body, what is the profit?',
'2:17': 'So also [1]faith, if it does not have works, is [a]dead [2]in itself.',
'2:18': 'But someone will say, You have faith, and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my [a]works.',
'2:19': 'You believe that God is [a]one. You do well; the [b]demons also believe and shudder.',
'2:20': 'But are you willing to know, O vain man, that faith without its works is [1]useless?',
'2:21': 'Was not Abraham our father justified by works in that he offered up [a]Isaac his son upon the altar?',
'2:22': 'You see that [a]faith worked together with his works, and by these works faith was perfected.',
'2:23': 'And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, &ldquo;And Abraham [a]believed God, and it was [b]accounted to him as righteousness&rdquo;; and he was called the [c]friend of God.',
'2:24': 'You see that a man is [1]justified by [a]works and not by [b]faith only.',
'2:25': 'And in like manner was not also [a]Rahab the harlot justified by works in that she received the messengers and [1]sent <I>them</I> out by a different way?',
'2:26': 'For just as the body without the [1]spirit is dead, so also faith without works is [a]dead.',
'3:1': 'Do not become many [1a]teachers, my [b]brothers, knowing that we will receive greater [2c]judgment.',
'3:2': 'For in many things we all stumble. If anyone does not stumble in [a]word, this one is a [b]perfect man, able to [c]bridle the whole body as well.',
'3:3': 'Now if we put [a]bridles into the mouths of horses that they would obey us, we direct their whole body as well.',
'3:4': 'Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are directed by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the pilot wills.',
'3:5': 'So also the [a]tongue is a little member yet boasts great things. Behold, how great a forest so little a [1]fire ignites!',
'3:6': 'And the tongue is a [1a]fire; the <I>very</I> world of unrighteousness, the tongue is set among our members as that which [b]contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the [2]course of life and is set on fire by [3]Gehenna.',
'3:7': 'For every nature, both of beasts and of birds, both of reptiles and of creatures of the sea, is tamed and has been tamed by the human [1]nature;',
'3:8': 'But the tongue no one among men is able to tame; <I>it</I> <I>is</I> a [1]restless evil, full of deadly [a]poison.',
'3:9': 'With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made according to the [a]likeness of God.',
'3:10': 'Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing. These things, my brothers, ought not to be so.',
'3:11': 'Does the spring, out of the same [1]opening, gush forth the sweet and the bitter?',
'3:12': 'Can a fig tree, my brothers, produce olives? Or a vine, [a]figs? Neither <I>can</I> [1]salt water produce sweet.',
'3:13': 'Who is [a]wise and understanding among you? Let him show [1]by his [b]good manner of life his [2c]works in [3d]meekness of [e]wisdom.',
'3:14': 'But if you have bitter [a]jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not boast and lie against the [b]truth.',
'3:15': '[1]This wisdom is not that which descends from [a]above, but is [2]earthly, [b]soulish, [c]demonic.',
'3:16': 'For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there [a]disorder and every worthless practice are.',
'3:17': 'But the [1a]wisdom from above is first [b]pure, then [c]peaceable, [2]forbearing, [3]compliant, full of [d]mercy and good [e]fruit, [f]impartial, [g]without hypocrisy.',
'3:18': 'And the [1a]fruit of righteousness is [b]sown in [c]peace [2]by those who [d]make peace.',
'4:1': 'Where <I>do</I> wars and fightings among you <I>come</I> <I>from</I>? Are they not from this, from your [1a]pleasures that [b]war in your members?',
'4:2': 'You [1a]lust and do not have; you [b]murder and are [c]jealous and are not able to obtain; you fight and make war. You do not have because you do not ask;',
'4:3': 'You [a]ask and do not receive because you ask evilly that you may spend <I>it</I> on your [b]pleasures.',
'4:4': '[1a]Adulteresses, do you not know that the [2]friendship of the [3b]world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a [c]friend of the world is constituted an [4]enemy of God.',
'4:5': 'Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: &ldquo;The [1]Spirit, whom He has caused to [2a]dwell in us, longs to envy&rdquo;?',
'4:6': 'But He gives [a]greater grace; therefore [1]it says, [2]&ldquo;God resists the [3b]proud but gives grace to the [c]humble.&rdquo;',
'4:7': '[1]Be subject therefore to God; but [2a]withstand the [3b]devil, and he will flee from you.',
'4:8': '[a]Draw near to God, and He will [b]draw near to you. [c]Cleanse <I>your</I> hands, sinners, and [d]purify <I>your</I> hearts, <I>you</I> [1]double-souled!',
'4:9': '[1]Endure [a]misery and [b]mourn and [c]weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into dejection.',
'4:10': '[1]Be [a]humbled before the Lord, and He will [b]exalt you.',
'4:11': 'Do not speak against [a]one another, brothers. He who speaks against a brother or [b]judges his brother speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a [1c]doer of the law but a judge.',
'4:12': 'One is [a]Lawgiver and [b]Judge, who is able to save and [c]destroy. But who are you who [d]judge your neighbor?',
'4:13': 'Come now, you who say, Today or tomorrow we [1]will go into this or that city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit;',
'4:14': 'Whereas you do not know the matter of [a]tomorrow, what your [b]life will be; for you are a [1c]vapor, which appears for a little while and then disappears.',
'4:15': 'Instead you <I>ought</I> to say, If the Lord [a]wills, we will both live and do this or that.',
'4:16': 'But now you [a]boast in your [1]arrogance; all such boasting is evil.',
'4:17': '[1]Therefore to him who [a]knows to do good and does not do <I>it</I>, to him it is [b]sin.',
'5:1': 'Come now, you [1a]rich, [b]weep, [c]howling over your miseries, which are coming upon you!',
'5:2': 'Your [a]riches have rotted and your garments have become [b]moth-eaten;',
'5:3': 'Your gold and your silver have [a]rusted, and their rust will be a testimony against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up [b]treasure in the last days.',
'5:4': 'Behold, the [a]wages of the workmen who mowed your fields, which have been withheld by you, cry out; and the [1]cries of those who reaped have entered into the ears of the [2]Lord of hosts.',
'5:5': 'You have lived [a]luxuriously on the earth and have [b]given yourselves to pleasure; you have [1]nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.',
'5:6': 'You condemned, you murdered the [1]righteous; he does not [a]resist you.',
'5:7': 'Therefore be [1]long-suffering, [a]brothers, until the [2b]coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer eagerly [c]awaits the precious fruit of the earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late [d]rain.',
'5:8': 'You also be [1]long-suffering; [a]establish your hearts because the [2b]coming of the Lord has drawn [c]near.',
'5:9': 'Do not [1]complain, brothers, against [a]one another lest you be [b]judged. Behold, the [2c]Judge stands before the [d]doors.',
'5:10': 'As an example, brothers, of [1]suffering evil and of [2]long-suffering, take the [a]prophets, who spoke [3]in the [b]name of the Lord.',
'5:11': 'Behold, we call those who [1]endured [a]blessed. You have heard of the endurance of [b]Job, and you have seen his [c]end from the Lord, that the Lord is very tenderhearted and [d]compassionate.',
'5:12': 'But [1]above all things, my brothers, do [2]not swear, neither by heaven nor by earth nor with any other oath; but let your [3]yes be yes, and your no, no, [4]lest you fall under [a]judgment.',
'5:13': 'Does anyone among you suffer evil? Let him [1]pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him [2a]sing praise.',
'5:14': 'Is anyone among you [1]ill? Let him [2]call for the [a]elders of the [b]church, and let them pray over him, [3c]anointing him with oil [4]in the [d]name of the Lord.',
'5:15': 'And the [1]prayer of [a]faith will save the one who is [2b]sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has [3]committed sins, it will be [c]forgiven him.',
'5:16': 'Therefore [a]confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be [b]healed. The [c]petition of a righteous man [1]avails much in its working.',
'5:17': '[a]Elijah was a man of [b]like feeling with us, and he [1]earnestly prayed that it would not rain; and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.',
'5:18': 'And he prayed again, and heaven gave [a]rain, and the earth sprouted forth <I>with</I> its fruit.',
'5:19': 'My [a]brothers, if any one among you is [1b]led astray from the [c]truth and someone [d]turns him back,',
'5:20': 'Let him know that he who turns a [1]sinner back from the error of his way will [2a]save that one&rsquo;s soul from [3]death and will [4b]cover a multitude of [5]sins.',

However, for the writer to call these believers in Christ &ldquo;the twelve tribes,&rdquo; as God&rsquo;s chosen people were called in His Old Testament economy, indicates that he lacked a clear view concerning the distinction between Christians and Jews, between God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the Old Testament dispensation. Apparently, he did not see that in the New Testament God had delivered and separated the Jewish believers in Christ from the Jewish people, who were then considered by God a perverse generation ({Act2:40|Acts 2:40}). In His New Testament economy, God does not consider the Jewish believers to be Jews set apart for Judaism but Christians set apart for the church. As members of the church of God, they should be as distinct and separate from the Jews as they are from the Gentiles ({1Co10:32|1&nbsp;Cor. 10:32}). Yet James, a pillar of the church, in his Epistle to the Christian brothers still called them &ldquo;the twelve tribes.&rdquo; (This might have been the reason that he addressed the word in {Jam5:1|5:1}-{Jam5:6|6} to the rich class in general among the Jews.)

His use of this expression might have been based on {Psa19:7|Psa. 19:7}-{Psa19:8|8}, which says that the law is perfect, that it restores the soul, i.e., gives people freedom, and that it makes the heart joyous, implying release and freedom, and on {Psa119:11|Psa. 119:11}, which says that keeping the law in our hearts frees us from sin. James uplifted the Old Testament law of letters to the uttermost, mixing God&rsquo;s New Testament economy with the outdated Old Testament economy ({Act21:18|Acts 21:18}-{Act21:20|20}). In his consideration the law was a primary means of Christian perfection. In contrast, the apostle Paul said that the law can do nothing to perfect us ({Heb7:19|Heb. 7:19}; cf. {Gal3:3|Gal. 3:3}). Cf. {Jam2:12^2|note 12<sup>2</sup>} in {Jam2|ch. 2}.","In God&rsquo;s New Testament dispensation Christ has ended the law ({Rom10:4|Rom. 10:4}; {Heb10:9|Heb. 10:9}), and the believers have been freed by Christ from the yoke of slavery of the law ({Gal5:1|Gal. 5:1}), have died to the law ({Gal2:19|Gal. 2:19}), and are no longer under the law but under grace ({Rom6:14|Rom. 6:14}; cf. {Joh1:17|John 1:17}). Moreover, the law of letters written on tablets of stone outside us has been replaced by the law of life inscribed on our hearts ({Heb8:10|Heb. 8:10}), the moral standard of which corresponds with that of the kingdom&rsquo;s constitution, decreed by the Lord on the mount ({Mat5|Matt. 5}&mdash;{Mat7|7}). Since the law of letters was not able to give man life ({Gal3:21|Gal. 3:21}) but was able only to expose man&rsquo;s weakness and failure and keep him in slavery ({Gal5:1|Gal. 5:1} and {Gal5:1^4|note 4}), it was a law of bondage. Since the law of life is the function of the divine life, which was imparted into our being at regeneration and supplies us throughout our Christian life with the unsearchable riches of the divine life to free us from the law of sin and death and fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law of letters ({Rom8:2|Rom. 8:2}, {Rom8:4|4}), it should be considered the law of freedom. This law is the law of Christ ({1Co9:21|1&nbsp;Cor. 9:21}), even Christ Himself, who lives within us to regulate us by imparting the divine nature into our being, that we may live a life that expresses God&rsquo;s image. It is this law that should be considered the basic rule of the Christian life for practical Christian perfection."]},

James&rsquo;s writing concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is not as striking as Paul&rsquo;s, Peter&rsquo;s, and John&rsquo;s. Paul focuses on Christ living and being formed in us ({Gal2:20|Gal. 2:20}; {Gal4:19|4:19}) and Christ being magnified in us and lived out of us ({Phi1:20|Phil. 1:20}-{Phi1:21|21}) that we as the church, His Body, may become His fullness, His expression ({Eph1:22|Eph. 1:22}-{Eph1:23|23}).

John emphasizes the eternal life, given to us for our fellowship with the Triune God ({1Jo1:2|1&nbsp;John 1:2}-{1Jo1:3|3}), and the divine birth, which brings into us the divine life as the divine seed that we may live out a life that is like God ({1Jo2:29|1&nbsp;John 2:29}; {1Jo3:9|3:9}; {1Jo4:17|4:17}) and be the church, a lampstand, which bears the testimony of Jesus ({Rev1:9|Rev. 1:9}, {Rev1:11|11}-{Rev1:12|12}) and which will consummate in the New Jerusalem for God&rsquo;s expression unto eternity ({Rev21:2|Rev. 21:2}-{Rev21:3|3}, {Rev21:10|10}-{Rev21:11|11}). Of the matters that are characteristic of the New Testament, James stresses only God&rsquo;s begetting of us ({Jam1:18|v. 18}), the indwelling Spirit ({Jam4:5|4:5}), and a minor aspect of the church ({Jam5:14|5:14}). He does not speak of Christ as our life or of the church as the expression of Christ, the two most outstanding and dispensational characteristics of the New Testament. This Epistle shows that James must have been very religious. It might have been because of this and his practical Christian perfection that he was reputed to be, along with Peter and John, a pillar, even the first, in the church at Jerusalem ({Gal2:9|Gal. 2:9}). However, he was not strong in the revelation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Christ but was still under the influence of the background of the old Judaic religion, the primary elements of which were to worship God by ceremonies and to live a life in the fear of God. This is proved by the words in {Act21:20|Acts 21:20}-{Act21:24|24} and in {Jam2:2|2:2}-{Jam2:11|11} of this Epistle.

They were unaware that the dispensation of law was altogether over and that the dispensation of grace should be fully honored, and that any disregard of the distinction between these two dispensations would be against God&rsquo;s dispensational administration and would be a great damage to God&rsquo;s economical plan for the building up of the church as the expression of Christ. Thus, this Epistle was written under the cloud of a semi-Judaic mixture, under a background that was obscured. Many who practice religion according to their natural concept neglect the background seen in this book."]},
