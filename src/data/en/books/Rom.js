verses: {
'1:1': '[1]Paul, a [2]slave of [3]Christ [4]Jesus, a [5]called [6]apostle, [7]separated [8]unto the [9]gospel of God,',
'1:2': '[1]Which He promised [2]beforehand through His prophets in the [3]holy Scriptures,',
'1:3': 'Concerning [1]His Son, who [2]came [3]out of the [4a]seed of David according to the [5]flesh,',
'1:4': 'Who was [1]designated the [2a]Son of God in [3]power according to the [4]Spirit of [5]holiness [6]out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;',
'1:5': 'Through whom we have received [1]grace and [2]apostleship unto the [3a]obedience of [4b]faith among all the Gentiles [5]on behalf of His name,',
'1:6': 'Among whom you also are the [1]called ones of Jesus Christ;',
'1:7': 'To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, the [a]called [1]saints: [2]Grace to you and [b]peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.',
'1:8': 'First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all because your [a]faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.',
'1:9': 'For God is my witness, whom I [1]serve in my [2]spirit in the gospel of His Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you always in my prayers,',
'1:10': 'Beseeching if by any means now at last I may be prospered in the will of God to come to you.',
'1:11': 'For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift so that you may be [a]established;',
'1:12': 'That is, that I with <I>you</I> may be [1]encouraged among you through the faith which is in one another, both yours and mine.',
'1:13': 'And I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I [a]purposed to come to you (yet was hindered until the present), that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the rest of the Gentiles.',
'1:14': 'I am debtor both to Greeks and to [1]barbarians, both to wise and to foolish;',
'1:15': 'So, for my part, I am ready to announce the gospel to you also who are in Rome.',
'1:16': 'For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the [1]power of God unto [2]salvation to everyone who believes, both to Jew first and to Greek.',
'1:17': 'For the [1a]righteousness of God is revealed in it [2]out of faith to faith, as it is written, [b]&ldquo;But the righteous shall [3]have life and live by [4]faith.&rdquo;',
'1:18': '[1]For the [2a]wrath of God is revealed from heaven [3]upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who [4]hold down [5]the truth in unrighteousness,',
'1:19': 'Because that which is known of God is manifest [1]within them, for God manifested <I>it</I> to them.',
'1:20': 'For the invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and [1]divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, [2a]being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse;',
'1:21': 'Because though [1]they knew God, they did not glorify <I>Him</I> as God or thank <I>Him</I>, but <I>rather</I> became [2]vain in their reasonings, and their heart, lacking understanding, was darkened.',
'1:22': 'Professing to be wise, they became fools',
'1:23': 'And [1a]changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.',
'1:24': 'Therefore God [1]gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, so that they dishonor their bodies among themselves,',
'1:25': 'Who exchanged the [1]truth of God for the lie, and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is [a]blessed forever. Amen.',
'1:26': 'Therefore God gave them up to passions of dishonor; for their females exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature;',
'1:27': 'And likewise also the males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their craving toward one another, males with males committing unseemliness and fully receiving in themselves the retribution of their error which was due.',
'1:28': 'And even as they did not approve of holding God in <I>their</I> full knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things which are not fitting,',
'1:29': 'Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity;',
'1:30': 'Whisperers, slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,',
'1:31': 'Senseless, faithless, affectionless, merciless;',
'1:32': 'Who, though fully knowing the [1]righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also have fellow delight in those who practice <I>them</I>.',
'2:1': 'Therefore you are without excuse, O every man who [1]judges, for in what you judge another you condemn yourself; for you who judge practice the same things.',
'2:2': 'But we know that the [1]judgment of God is according to [2]truth upon those who practice such things.',
'2:3': 'And do you consider this, O man, who judge those who practice such things and do the same <I>yourself</I>, that you will escape the [1]judgment of God?',
'2:4': 'Or do you despise the riches of His kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that God&rsquo;s kindness is leading you to repentance?',
'2:5': 'But, according to your hardness and <I>your</I> unrepentant heart, you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the [a]righteous judgment of God,',
'2:6': 'Who will render to each according to his works:',
'2:7': '[1]To those who by endurance in good work seek glory and honor and incorruptibility, life eternal;',
'2:8': 'But to those who are selfishly contentious and disobedient to the [1]truth and obey unrighteousness, wrath and fury.',
'2:9': 'Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man who commits evil, both of Jew first and of Greek;',
'2:10': 'But glory and honor and peace to everyone who works good, both to Jew first and to Greek.',
'2:11': 'For there is no respect of persons with God.',
'2:12': 'For as many as have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law; and as many as have sinned [1]under the law shall be judged by the law',
'2:13': '(For <I>it</I> <I>is</I> not the hearers of the law <I>who</I> are righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.',
'2:14': 'For when Gentiles, who have no law, do [1]by nature the things of the law, these, though they have no law, are a law to themselves,',
'2:15': 'Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their [1]conscience bearing witness with <I>it</I> and their reasonings, one with the other, accusing or even excusing <I>them.</I>)',
'2:16': 'In the day when God judges the secrets of men according to my gospel [a]through Jesus Christ.',
'2:17': '[1]But if you bear the name of Jew, and rest upon the law, and [2]boast in God,',
'2:18': 'And know the will, and [1]approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,',
'2:19': 'And have confidence that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,',
'2:20': 'One who disciplines the foolish, a teacher of [1]babes, having the proper form of the knowledge and truth in the law;',
'2:21': '[1]You therefore who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?',
'2:22': 'You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob <I>their</I> temples?',
'2:23': 'You who boast in the law, do you by transgression of the law dishonor God?',
'2:24': 'For [a]&ldquo;the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,&rdquo; even as it is written.',
'2:25': 'For circumcision profits if you practice the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.',
'2:26': 'If therefore the uncircumcision keeps the [1]ordinances of the law, will not his uncircumcision be accounted as circumcision?',
'2:27': 'And the uncircumcision by nature, if he fulfills the law, will judge you who through the letter and circumcision are a transgressor of the law.',
'2:28': '[1]For he is [a]not a Jew who is one [2]outwardly; neither is [b]circumcision that which is outward in the flesh.',
'2:29': '[1]But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, [2a]in spirit, not [2]in letter, whose praise is not [3]from men, but [3]from God.',
'3:1': 'What then is the advantage of the Jew? Or what is the profit of the circumcision?',
'3:2': 'Much in every way. First, that they were entrusted with the oracles of God.',
'3:3': 'For what if some disbelieved? Shall their unbelief annul the faithfulness of God?',
'3:4': '[1]Absolutely not! But let God be true and every man a liar, as it is written, [a]&ldquo;That You may be [2]declared righteous in Your words and may overcome when You are judged.&rdquo;',
'3:5': 'But if our unrighteousness commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is the God who inflicts wrath unrighteous? I speak according to man.',
'3:6': 'Absolutely not! Otherwise how shall God judge the world?',
'3:7': 'But if the [1a]truthfulness of God has abounded in my lie unto His glory, why still am I also being judged as a sinner?',
'3:8': 'And why not <I>say</I> (as we are slanderously charged and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil that good may come? whose [1]judgment is just.',
'3:9': 'What then? Are we better? Not at all! For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,',
'3:10': 'Even as it is written, [a]&ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one;',
'3:11': 'There is none who understands, there is none who seeks out God.',
'3:12': 'All have turned aside; together they have become useless; there is none who does [1]good; there is not so much as one.',
'3:13': '[a]Their throat is an opened grave; with their tongues they practiced deceit; [b]the poison of asps is under their lips;',
'3:14': '[a]Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.',
'3:15': '[a]Swift are their feet to shed blood,',
'3:16': 'Destruction and misery are in their ways,',
'3:17': 'And the [1]way of peace they have not known.',
'3:18': '[a]There is no fear of God before their eyes.&rdquo;',
'3:19': 'Now we know that whatever things the law says, it speaks to those who are under the law, [1]that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God;',
'3:20': 'Because [a]out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him; for [b]through the law is the clear knowledge of sin.',
'3:21': 'But now, [1]apart from the law, the [2]righteousness of God has been [3]manifested, witness being borne to <I>it</I> by the Law and the Prophets;',
'3:22': 'Even the righteousness of God through the [1]faith of Jesus Christ to all those who believe, for there is no distinction;',
'3:23': 'For [a]all have sinned and fall short of the [1]glory of God,',
'3:24': 'Being [1]justified [2]freely by His grace through the [3]redemption which is in Christ Jesus;',
'3:25': 'Whom God [1]set forth as a [2a]propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God [3]passed over the sins that had previously occurred,',
'3:26': 'With a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who [1]justifies him who is of the [2]faith of Jesus.',
'3:27': 'Where then is boasting? [1]It is excluded. Through what kind of law? That of works? No, but through the law of faith.',
'3:28': 'For we account that [a]a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.',
'3:29': 'Or is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not of the Gentiles also? Yes, of the Gentiles also,',
'3:30': 'If indeed God is one, who will justify the circumcision [1]out of faith and the [a]uncircumcision [1]through faith.',
'3:31': 'Do we then make the law of no effect through faith? Absolutely not! Rather, we establish the law.',
'4:1': '[1]What then shall we say that Abraham our [2]forefather according to the flesh has found?',
'4:2': 'For if Abraham was justified out of [1]works, he has something to boast in, but not before God.',
'4:3': 'For what does the Scripture say? [a]&ldquo;And Abraham [1]believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.&rdquo;',
'4:4': 'Now to the [1]one who [a]works, his [2]wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due.',
'4:5': 'But to the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness.',
'4:6': 'Even as David also speaks blessing on the man to whom God accounts righteousness apart from works:',
'4:7': '[a]&ldquo;Blessed are they whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over.',
'4:8': '[a]Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall by no means account sin.&rdquo;',
'4:9': 'Is this blessing then upon the circumcision <I>only</I>, or also upon the uncircumcision? For we say, Faith was accounted to Abraham as righteousness.',
'4:10': 'How then was it accounted? While he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.',
'4:11': 'And he [a]received the [1]sign of circumcision, a seal of the [2]righteousness of the faith which <I>he</I> <I>had</I> while in uncircumcision, that he might be the father of all those in uncircumcision who believe, that righteousness might be accounted to them also,',
'4:12': 'And the father of circumcision to those who not only are of the circumcision, but who also [1a]walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <I>he</I> <I>had</I> in uncircumcision.',
'4:13': 'For <I>it</I> <I>was</I> not through the law <I>that</I> [a]the promise <I>was</I> <I>made</I> to Abraham or to his seed [b]that he would be the [1]heir of the world, but through the [2]righteousness of faith.',
'4:14': 'For [a]if those of the law are heirs, faith has been made void and the promise has been annulled;',
'4:15': 'For [a]the law works out wrath; but [b]where there is no law, neither is there transgression.',
'4:16': 'Therefore <I>the</I> <I>inheritance</I> <I>is</I> out of faith that <I>it</I> <I>might</I> <I>be</I> according to [a]grace, so that the promise may be certain to all the seed, not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the [1]father of us all',
'4:17': '(As it is written, [a]&ldquo;I have appointed you a father of many nations&rdquo;) in the sight of God whom he [1]believed, [b]who [2]gives life to the dead and [3]calls the things not being as being.',
'4:18': 'He beyond hope believed [1]in hope in order that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, [a]&ldquo;So shall your seed be.&rdquo;',
'4:19': 'And not weakening in his faith, he considered his own body as [1a]already dead, [b]being about a hundred years old, as well as the [c]deadening of Sarah&rsquo;s womb;',
'4:20': 'But with regard to the promise of God, he did not doubt in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God',
'4:21': 'And being fully persuaded that [a]what He had promised He was able also to do.',
'4:22': 'Therefore also it was accounted to him as righteousness.',
'4:23': 'Now it was not written for his sake only that it was accounted to him,',
'4:24': 'But for ours also to whom it is to be accounted, who believe on [1]Him who has raised Jesus our Lord from the dead,',
'4:25': 'Who was delivered for our offenses and was [1]raised [a]for our justification.',
'5:1': 'Therefore having been [a]justified out of faith, we have [b]peace [1]toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,',
'5:2': 'Through whom also we have obtained access by [1]faith into this [2a]grace in which we [3]stand and [4]boast because of the [5b]hope of the [c]glory of God.',
'5:3': 'And not only so, but we also boast in our [1]tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces [2]endurance;',
'5:4': 'And endurance, [1]approvedness; and approvedness, [a]hope;',
'5:5': 'And hope does not put <I>us</I> to shame, because the [1a]love of God has been [b]poured out in our [c]hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.',
'5:6': 'For while we were yet [1]weak, in due time Christ [a]died for the ungodly.',
'5:7': 'For scarcely for a righteous man will anyone die, though perhaps for the good man someone would even dare to die.',
'5:8': 'But God commends His own [a]love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ [b]died for us.',
'5:9': 'Much more then, having now been justified in His [a]blood, we will be saved through Him from the [b]wrath.',
'5:10': 'For if we, being enemies, were [1a]reconciled to God through the death of His Son, [2]much more we will be [3]saved [4]in His [5b]life, having been reconciled,',
'5:11': 'And not only so, but also [1]boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the [a]reconciliation.',
'5:12': 'Therefore just as through [1a]one man [2b]sin entered into the [3]world, and [c]through sin, [4]death; and thus [4d]death passed on to all men because all have sinned&mdash;',
'5:13': 'For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not [1]charged to one&rsquo;s account when there is no [a]law.',
'5:14': 'But [1a]death reigned from [2]Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam&rsquo;s [3]transgression, [b]who is a [4]type of Him who was to come.',
'5:15': 'But <I>it</I> <I>is</I> not <I>that</I> as the offense was, so also the gracious gift is; for if by the offense of the [a]one the many died, much more the grace of God and the free gift in grace of the one [1b]man Jesus Christ have [2]abounded to the many.',
'5:16': 'And <I>it</I> <I>is</I> not <I>that</I> as through one who sinned, <I>so</I> <I>also</I> the free [1]gift is; for the judgment was out of one <I>offense</I> unto condemnation, but the gracious gift is out of many offenses unto [a]justification.',
'5:17': 'For if, by the offense of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the [1]abundance of grace and of the gift of [2]righteousness will [3]reign in [4]life through the One, Jesus Christ.',
'5:18': 'So then as <I>it</I> <I>was</I> through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also <I>it</I> <I>was</I> through one [1]righteous act unto justification of [2]life to all men.',
'5:19': 'For just as through the disobedience of one man the many were [1]constituted sinners, so also through the [2]obedience of the One the many will be [1]constituted righteous.',
'5:20': 'And the [a]law entered in alongside that the offense might [1]abound; but where sin [1]abounded, grace has superabounded,',
'5:21': 'In order that just as [1a]sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through [2]righteousness unto [b]eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.',
'6:1': 'What then shall we say? [a]Should we continue in sin that [b]grace may abound?',
'6:2': 'Absolutely not! We who have [a]died to sin, how shall we still live in it?',
'6:3': 'Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been [1a]baptized into [2]Christ Jesus have been [1]baptized into [3]His death?',
'6:4': 'We have been [1a]buried therefore with Him through [2]baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was [b]raised from the dead through the [3c]glory of the Father, so also we might [4]walk in [d]newness of [e]life.',
'6:5': 'For if we have [1]grown together with <I>Him</I> in the [2]likeness of His death, indeed we will also be [3]<I>in</I> <I>the</I> [2]<I>likeness</I> of His resurrection,',
'6:6': '[1]Knowing this, that our [2]old man has been [3a]crucified with <I>Him</I> in order that the [4b]body of sin might be [5]annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves;',
'6:7': 'For he who has died is justified from [1]sin.',
'6:8': 'Now if we have [a]died [1]with Christ, we believe that we will also [b]live [1]with Him,',
'6:9': 'Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, [a]dies [1]no more; death lords it over Him no more.',
'6:10': 'For <I>the</I> <I>death</I> which He died, He died to sin once for all; but <I>the</I> <I>life</I> which He lives, He lives to God.',
'6:11': 'So also you, [1]reckon yourselves to be [a]dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.',
'6:12': '[1]Do not let [a]sin therefore reign in your mortal body so that you obey [2]the body&rsquo;s [b]lusts;',
'6:13': 'Neither [a]present your [b]members as [c]weapons of unrighteousness to sin, but [1]present yourselves to God as alive from the dead, and your members as [2]weapons of righteousness to God.',
'6:14': 'For [a]sin will not [1]lord it over you, [2]for you are [3]not under the law but under [b]grace.',
'6:15': 'What then? [a]Should we sin, because we are not under the law but under grace? Absolutely not!',
'6:16': 'Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as slaves for obedience, <I>his</I> slaves you are whom you obey, whether of sin [1]unto death or of obedience [1]unto righteousness?',
'6:17': 'But thanks be to God that though you were [a]slaves of sin, you have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which you were delivered.',
'6:18': 'And having been [1a]freed from sin, you were enslaved to righteousness.',
'6:19': 'I speak in human <I>terms</I> because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now [a]present your members as slaves to righteousness [1]unto [2b]sanctification.',
'6:20': 'For when you were [a]slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.',
'6:21': 'What fruit then did you have at that time? Things of which you are now ashamed, for the end of those things is death.',
'6:22': 'But now, having been [a]freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto [1b]sanctification, and the end, [c]eternal [2]life.',
'6:23': 'For the [1]wages of sin is [2a]death, but the gift of God is [3b]eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.',
'7:1': 'Or are you ignorant, brothers (for I speak to those who know the law), that the [1]law lords it over the man as long as he lives?',
'7:2': 'For the married woman is bound by the [1]law to her [2]husband while he is living; but if the husband dies, she is discharged from the [1]law regarding the husband.',
'7:3': 'So then if, while the husband is living, she is joined to [1]another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she is joined to [1]another man.',
'7:4': 'So then, my brothers, [1]you also [a]have been made dead to the law through the body of Christ so that [1]you might be [2]joined to [b]another, to Him who has been raised from the dead, that we might [3]bear fruit to God.',
'7:5': 'For when we were in the flesh, the passions for sins, which <I>acted</I> through the law, operated in our members to bear fruit to death.',
'7:6': 'But now we have been [1]discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we [2]serve in [3]newness of [4]spirit and not in oldness of letter.',
'7:7': 'What then shall we say? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! But [1]I did not [a]know sin except through the [2]law; for neither did I know coveting, except the law had said, [3b]&ldquo;You shall not covet.&rdquo;',
'7:8': 'But [1]sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind; for without the law sin is dead.',
'7:9': 'And I was alive without the law once; but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died.',
'7:10': 'And the commandment, which was unto life, this very <I>commandment</I> was found to me to be unto [1]death.',
'7:11': 'For sin, seizing the opportunity [1]through the commandment, [a]deceived me and [b]through it killed <I>me</I>.',
'7:12': 'So then the law is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.',
'7:13': 'Did then that which is good become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin <I>did</I>, that it might [1]be shown to be sin by working out death in me through that which is good, that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.',
'7:14': 'For we [1]know that the law is [2]spiritual; but I am [3]fleshy, sold under sin.',
'7:15': 'For what I work out, I [1]do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do.',
'7:16': 'But if what I do not will, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good.',
'7:17': 'Now then <I>it</I> <I>is</I> [a]no longer I <I>that</I> work it out but sin that [1]dwells in me.',
'7:18': 'For I [1]know that in me, that is, in my [2]flesh, [3]nothing good dwells; for [4]to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.',
'7:19': 'For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice.',
'7:20': 'But if what I do not will, this I do, <I>it</I> <I>is</I> [a]no longer I <I>that</I> work it out but sin that dwells in me.',
'7:21': 'I find then [1]the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the [2]evil is present with me.',
'7:22': 'For I delight in the [1]law of God according to the inner man,',
'7:23': 'But I see a different [1]law in my members, [2]warring against the law of my mind and making me a [3]captive to the [a]law of sin which is in my members.',
'7:24': '[1]Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from [2]the body of [3]this death?',

The noun slavery, from the same root as slave, is used in {Rom8:15|8:15}, {Rom8:21|21}.","Paul&rsquo;s use of this term indicates that he was not a self-appointed apostle or one hired by the Lord; rather, he was one purchased to serve God and minister to His people, not in the natural life but in the regenerated life (see {Exo12:44|Exo. 12:44}; {Exo21:6|21:6}; {Mat20:26^1|note 26<sup>1</sup>} in {Mat20|Matt. 20}; {Mat25:14^3|note 14<sup>3</sup>} in {Mat25|Matt. 25}; and {Gal6:17^1|note 17<sup>1</sup>} in {Gal6|Gal. 6})."]},

By means of the facts in the Scriptures and the experience in the Holy Spirit, Paul shows us that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to make sinners sons of God and members of Christ to constitute the Body of Christ to express Him. This book offers a full definition of this, God&rsquo;s goal, unfolding a general sketch and details of both the Christian life and the church life.","This book may be divided into eight sections: introduction, condemnation, justification, sanctification, glorification, selection, transformation, and conclusion. In these eight sections three major structures can be seen: salvation ({Rom1:1|1:1}&mdash;{Rom5:11|5:11}; {Rom9:1|9:1}&mdash;{Rom11:36|11:36}), life ({Rom5:12|5:12}&mdash;{Rom8:39|8:39}), and building ({Rom12:1|12:1}&mdash;{Rom16:27|16:27})."]},

The Ark was the place where God met with people. In the Ark was the law of the Ten Commandments, which by its holy and righteous requirement exposed and condemned the sins of the people who came to contact God. However, by the lid of the Ark, with the propitiating blood sprinkled on it on the Day of Expiation, the entire situation on the sinner&rsquo;s side was fully covered. Therefore, upon this sin-covering lid God could meet with the people who broke His righteous law, and He could do this without, governmentally, any contradiction to His righteousness, even under the observing of the cherubim that bore His glory and overshadowed the lid of the Ark. Thus, the problem between man and God was appeased, enabling God to forgive and be merciful to man and thereby to give His grace to man. This is a prefigure of Christ as the Lamb of God taking away the sin that caused man to have a problem with God ({Joh1:29|John 1:29}), thus satisfying all the requirements of God&rsquo;s holiness, righteousness, and glory and appeasing the relationship between man and God. Hence, God could pass over the people&rsquo;s sins that had previously occurred. And, in order to show forth His righteousness, He had to do this. This is what this verse refers to.","The Hebrew word for the lid of the Ark is kapporeth, from a root meaning to cover. In the Septuagint this word is translated hilasterion, which means the place of propitiation (implying to forgive and to give mercy&mdash;the word rendered propitious in {Heb8:12|Heb. 8:12} is the root of hilasterion, and the word rendered propitiated in {Luk18:13|Luke 18:13} is derived from this root). The King James Version adopts the rendering &ldquo;mercy seat,&rdquo; referring to the place where God grants mercy to man. In {Heb9:5|Heb. 9:5} Paul also used hilasterion for the lid of the Ark. Here, in {Rom3:25|Rom. 3:25}, the same word, hilasterion, is used to show that the lid of the Ark signifies Christ as the propitiation place set forth by God.","In addition to hilasterion, two other words derived from the same Greek word as hilasterion are used in the New Testament to show how Christ took away man&rsquo;s sin to appease the relationship between man and God. One is hilaskomai ({Heb2:17|Heb. 2:17}), which means to propitiate, that is, to appease, to reconcile one by satisfying the other&rsquo;s demand; the other is hilasmos ({1Jo2:2|1&nbsp;John 2:2}; {1Jo4:10|4:10}), which means that which propitiates, that is, a propitiatory sacrifice. Christ made propitiation for our sins ({Heb2:17|Heb. 2:17}); hence, He has become that which propitiates, the propitiatory sacrifice, between us and God ({1Jo2:2|1&nbsp;John 2:2}; {1Jo4:10|4:10}), and He has also become the place, as typified by the lid of the Ark ({Heb9:5|Heb. 9:5}), where we enjoy propitiation before God and where God gives grace to us."]},

Likewise, this chapter indicates that justification is not merely for man to be delivered out of God&rsquo;s condemnation, but even more for God to gain many sons ({Rom8:29|8:29}-{Rom8:30|30}) to constitute the one Body of Christ ({Rom12|ch. 12}) as the kingdom of God ({Rom14:17|14:17}) for the fulfillment of His purpose.

These matters include the Triune God Himself ({Rom8:31|8:31}), as the Father ({Rom1:7|1:7}; {Rom8:15|8:15}), as the Son ({Rom1:4|1:4}; {Rom8:3|8:3}) (the Son being the Lord&mdash;{Rom1:4|1:4}, {Rom1:7|7}; {Rom10:12|10:12}; {Rom14:9|14:9}; being Jesus&mdash;{Rom3:26|3:26}; {Rom4:24|4:24}; being Christ&mdash;{Rom5:6|5:6}; {Rom6:4|6:4}; {Rom8:34|8:34}; {Rom6:3|6:3}; {Rom8:10|8:10}; {Rom13:14|13:14}; being the man&mdash;{Rom5:15|5:15}; and being the root of Jesse&mdash;{Rom15:12|15:12}), and as the Spirit ({Rom5:5|5:5}; {Rom8:16|8:16}, {Rom8:26|26}) (the Spirit being the firstfruits&mdash;{Rom8:23|8:23}); His mercy ({Rom9:23|9:23}; {Rom11:32|11:32}), His compassion ({Rom9:15|9:15}; {Rom12:1|12:1}), His love ({Rom5:5|5:5}; {Rom8:35|8:35}, {Rom8:39|39}), His kindness ({Rom2:4|2:4}; {Rom11:22|11:22}), His grace ({Rom5:2|5:2}, {Rom5:15|15}), His free gifts ({Rom5:15|5:15}-{Rom5:16|16}; {Rom11:29|11:29}), His gifts ({Rom12:6|12:6}), His righteousness ({Rom1:17|1:17}; {Rom3:21|3:21}), His Spirit of holiness ({Rom1:4|1:4}), His faithfulness ({Rom3:3|3:3}), His peace ({Rom15:33|15:33}; {Rom16:20|16:20}), His hope ({Rom15:13|15:13}), His joy ({Rom15:13|15:13}), His endurance ({Rom15:5|15:5}), His encouragement ({Rom15:5|15:5}), His riches ({Rom10:12|10:12}; {Rom11:33|11:33}), His wisdom ({Rom11:33|11:33}), His knowledge ({Rom11:33|11:33}), His power ({Rom1:16|1:16}), His authority ({Rom9:21|9:21}), His life ({Rom5:21|5:21}), His law of life ({Rom8:2|8:2}), His sonship ({Rom8:15|8:15}), His glory ({Rom5:2|5:2}; {Rom9:23|9:23}), and His kingdom ({Rom14:17|14:17}); His foreknowing ({Rom8:29|8:29}), His selection ({Rom9:11|9:11}; {Rom11:5|11:5}), His predestination ({Rom8:29|8:29}), His preparation ({Rom9:23|9:23}), His reserving ({Rom11:4|11:4}-{Rom11:5|5}), His calling ({Rom8:30|8:30}; {Rom11:29|11:29}), His grafting ({Rom11:17|11:17}), His redemption ({Rom3:24|3:24}), His propitiation ({Rom3:25|3:25}), His salvation ({Rom1:16|1:16}), His justification ({Rom3:26|3:26}, {Rom3:30|30}), His reconciliation ({Rom5:10|5:10}-{Rom5:11|11}), His freedom ({Rom8:2|8:2}), His sanctification ({Rom6:19|6:19}, {Rom6:22|22}), His transformation ({Rom12:2|12:2}), His renewing ({Rom12:2|12:2}), His conformation ({Rom8:29|8:29}), His redemption of our body ({Rom8:23|8:23}), and His glorification ({Rom8:30|8:30}); His receiving ({Rom14:3|14:3}; {Rom15:7|15:7}), His indwelling ({Rom8:11|8:11}), His life giving ({Rom8:11|8:11}), His leading ({Rom8:14|8:14}), His witnessing ({Rom8:16|8:16}), His helping ({Rom8:26|8:26}), His interceding within us ({Rom8:26|8:26}), His interceding in the heavens ({Rom8:34|8:34}), His giving all things to us ({Rom8:32|8:32}), and His causing all things to work for us ({Rom8:28|8:28}); plus His incarnation ({Rom1:3|1:3}; {Rom10:6|10:6}), His crucifixion ({Rom5:8|5:8}; {Rom6:6|6:6}), His blood ({Rom3:25|3:25}), His ending of the law ({Rom10:4|10:4}), His resurrection ({Rom4:25|4:25}; {Rom10:7|10:7}), and His ascension ({Rom8:34|8:34}). All have been made available, and most of these have been applied to the producing and building up of the church for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose according to His will ({Rom12:2|12:2}).","Four stations are revealed in this book: the matters covered in chs. {Rom1|1}&mdash;{Rom4|4} bring us in {Rom4|ch. 4} to the first station, the station of justification; chs. {Rom5|5}&mdash;{Rom8|8} lead us in {Rom8|ch. 8} to the second station, the station of sanctification; chs. {Rom9|9}&mdash;{Rom12|12} lead us in {Rom12|ch. 12} to the third station, the station of the Body of Christ; and chs. {Rom13|13}&mdash;{Rom16|16} take us in {Rom16|ch. 16} to the fourth station, the station of the churches expressed in different localities, the station of the practical living of the Body of Christ in different localities. The churches are the ultimate consummation of the complete salvation of the gospel of God revealed in this book, which was written not in the way of doctrine but in the way of practicality. In the first station we are regenerated and saved, in the second station we are sanctified, in the third station we are renewed and transformed, and in the fourth station, in the practical church life, Satan is crushed under our feet and we are able to fully enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s grace and God&rsquo;s peace ({Rom16:20|v. 20})."]},

This unveils that all the matters discussed in this book, such as how God selects us, how He saves us from sin and death, how He redeems us and justifies us, how He makes us, sinners who were dead through and through, His divine sons, how He transfers us out of Adam into Christ, how He sanctifies and transforms us in Christ, how He makes us the members of Christ for the constituting of the Body of Christ, and how He causes us to be the local churches appearing in different localities as the expressions of the Body of Christ on the earth in this age&mdash;all these matters are planned, managed, and accomplished by God&rsquo;s wisdom, in order that He, the unlimitedly rich Triune God, may be glorified, that is, that His incomparable glory may be completely and fully expressed through us who have been perfected eternally by Him and who have become His Body and have been joined to Him as one. The focus of God&rsquo;s wisdom is the working of His Divine Trinity into the three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;of our redeemed being that in His redemption, sanctification, and transformation we may have a full union in the divine life with Him, that His desire for the mingling of divinity and humanity, the joining of humanity to divinity, may be fulfilled for eternity. This truly is worthy of our appreciation and worship! How blessed and how glorious it is that we can participate in this! This is worthy of our unceasing singing and praise for eternity! Both our Christian life and our church life should have this as our center and goal. May God bless in this way everyone who has been chosen and perfected by Him.","Through God&rsquo;s divine dispensing in us and His divine union with us, we can experience and enjoy the saving in Christ&rsquo;s life in God&rsquo;s full salvation (see {Rom5:10^2|note 10<sup>2</sup>} in {Rom5|ch. 5}), as conveyed to us in this book, in the following aspects:","(1) By the abundance of grace (God Himself) and of the gift of righteousness (Christ Himself) which we received, we are able to reign in Christ&rsquo;s divine life ({Rom5:17|5:17}) over sin, death, the old man, the flesh, Satan, the world, and all persons, matters, and things that do not submit to God.","(2) God&rsquo;s holy nature sanctifies our worldly disposition ({Rom6:19|6:19}, {Rom6:22|22}; {Rom15:16|15:16}). God sanctifies us dispositionally out of His divine life and unto His divine life that we may enjoy more of His divine life.","(3) The indwelling law of the Spirit of life, that is, the automatic and spontaneous working of the Triune God as life in us, frees us from the law of sin and of death, the slavery and bondage of sin ({Rom8:2|8:2}, {Rom8:11|11}). The operation of this law comes out of God&rsquo;s divine life, and it also causes the increase of the divine life in us.","(4) The Divine Trinity&rsquo;s divine dispensing in our spirit, soul, and body causes these three parts to be saturated with the processed divine life ({Rom8:5|8:5}-{Rom8:11|11}), with the result that our entire being is completely united with the processed Triune God and mingled with Him as one.","(5) The renewing of our mind by the Spirit results in the transformation of our soul, which saves us from being conformed to the modern style of the world ({Rom12:2|12:2}) and issues in all the virtues and the overcoming, mentioned in chs. {Rom12|12}&mdash;{Rom16|16}, as our daily life, a life of the highest standard, and as our church life, a life that is all-overcoming.","(6) By the renewing of our mind and the transformation of our soul, we become members one of another with all believers in the Body of Christ and are built up together as the Body of Christ and thereby have the service of the Body ({Rom12:1|12:1}, {Rom12:3|3}-{Rom12:8|8}). This is the crystallization of our experience of the saving in Christ&rsquo;s life.","(7) Based on the revelation and teaching in chs. {Rom14|14}&mdash;{Rom16|16} of this book, we live the life of the local church in different localities as the appearance of the Body of Christ, the universal church, in different localities.","(8) By becoming the built-up church, a church against which the gates of Hades cannot prevail, in different localities, we afford God the opportunity to crush Satan under our feet that we may enjoy Christ as our rich grace and the God of peace as our surpassing peace ({Rom16:20|16:20}).","(9) In our experience of the various aspects of the saving in the divine life, as mentioned above, we are being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God ({Rom8:28|8:28}-{Rom8:29|29}) through the &ldquo;all things&rdquo; arranged under God&rsquo;s sovereignty, so that we have His divine attributes and His human virtues and thereby express the glory and beauty of Him, the God-man.","(10) In the process of our experience of the saving in the divine life, the splendor of the divine life gradually saturates us until it saturates our body, issuing in the redemption of our body ({Rom8:23|8:23}), that our spirit, soul, and body may all enter into the glory of God ({Rom8:30|8:30}, {Rom8:17|17}).
