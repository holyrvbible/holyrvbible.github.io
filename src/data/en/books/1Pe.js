verses: {
'1:1': '[1a]Peter, an [2b]apostle of Jesus Christ, to the [3c]sojourners of the [4d]dispersion of [5e]Pontus, [f]Galatia, Cappadocia, [g]Asia, and [h]Bithynia,',
'1:2': '[1a]Chosen [2]according to the [3b]foreknowledge of God the Father [4]in the [5c]sanctification of the Spirit [6]unto the [7d]obedience and [8e]sprinkling of the [9]blood of Jesus Christ: [10]Grace to you and [11]peace be [12f]multiplied.',
'1:3': '[1a]Blessed be the [2]God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great [3b]mercy has [4c]regenerated us [5]unto a [6]living [d]hope [7]through the [e]resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,',
'1:4': '[1]Unto an [2a]inheritance, [3]incorruptible and undefiled and [b]unfading, [4c]kept in the heavens for you,',
'1:5': 'Who are being [1a]guarded [2]by the power of God [3]through faith [4]unto a [5]salvation ready to be [b]revealed at the [6c]last time;',
'1:6': 'In which [1]<I>time</I> you [a]exult, though for a [b]little while at present, if it must be, you have been made sorrowful by various [2c]trials,',
'1:7': 'So that the [1a]proving of your faith, [2]much more [3]precious than of gold which perishes though it is [b]proved by fire, may be found [4]unto [c]praise and [d]glory and honor at the [5e]revelation of Jesus Christ;',
'1:8': 'Whom having not [a]seen, you [1b]love; [2]into whom though not seeing <I>Him</I> at present, yet [3c]believing, you [d]exult with [4]joy <I>that</I> <I>is</I> unspeakable and [4]full of glory,',
'1:9': '[1]Receiving the end of your faith, the [a]salvation of your [2b]souls.',
'1:10': 'Concerning this salvation the [1a]prophets, who prophesied concerning the [2]grace <I>that</I> <I>was</I> <I>to</I> <I>come</I> unto you, sought and searched diligently,',
'1:11': '[1]Searching into [2]what <I>time</I> or what manner of time the Spirit [3]of Christ in them was making clear, testifying beforehand of the [4]sufferings [5]of Christ and the [6]glories after these.',
'1:12': 'To them it was revealed that not to themselves but to you they ministered [1]these things, which have now been announced to you through those who [2]preached the gospel to you by the Holy [a]Spirit sent from heaven, which things angels long to [3]look into.',
'1:13': '[1]Therefore [a]girding up the loins of your mind <I>and</I> being [2b]sober, set your [3]hope perfectly on the [4c]grace being brought to you at the [d]revelation of Jesus Christ.',
'1:14': 'As children of [a]obedience, do not be [1]fashioned according to the former [b]lusts in your [c]ignorance;',
'1:15': 'But according to the [1]Holy One who [a]called you, you yourselves also [2]be [b]holy in all <I>your</I> [c]manner of life;',
'1:16': 'Because it is written, &ldquo;You shall be [a]holy because I am holy.&rdquo;',
'1:17': 'And if you call <I>as</I> [1a]Father the One who [b]without respect of persons [2c]judges according to each one&rsquo;s [3]work, pass the time of your [d]sojourning in [4e]fear,',
'1:18': 'Knowing that <I>it</I> <I>was</I> not with corruptible things, with [1a]silver or gold, <I>that</I> you were [b]redeemed [c]from your [2d]vain manner of life handed down from your fathers,',
'1:19': 'But with [1]precious [a]blood, as of a [b]Lamb [c]without blemish and without spot, <I>the</I> <I>blood</I> of Christ;',
'1:20': 'Who was [1a]foreknown [b]before the foundation of the world but has been [c]manifested in the [2d]last of times for your sake,',
'1:21': 'Who [1]through Him believe into God, who [a]raised Him from the dead and [2]gave Him [b]glory, so that your [3]faith and [c]hope are in God.',
'1:22': 'Since you have [1]purified your [2a]souls by your obedience to the [3]truth unto unfeigned [4b]brotherly love, love one another [5]from a pure heart fervently,',
'1:23': '[1]Having been [a]regenerated not of corruptible [2b]seed but of incorruptible, through <I>the</I> [c]living and abiding word of God.',
'1:24': 'For &ldquo;all [1]flesh is like [a]grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass has withered, and the flower has fallen off,',
'1:25': 'But the [1]word of the [2]Lord abides forever.&rdquo; And this is the [a]word which has been announced to you as the [3b]gospel.',
'2:1': '[1]Therefore putting away all [2a]malice and all guile and [b]hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings,',
'2:2': 'As [1]newborn [a]babes, long for the [2]guileless [b]milk [3]of the word in order that by it you may [4c]grow [5]unto [d]salvation,',
'2:3': 'If you have [1a]tasted that the Lord is [2]good.',
'2:4': 'Coming to Him, a [1]living [a]stone, [b]rejected by men but with God [c]chosen <I>and</I> [2]precious,',
'2:5': 'You yourselves also, as [1]living [a]stones, are being [2b]built up as a [3]spiritual [4c]house [5]into a [6]holy [7]priesthood to offer up [8]spiritual sacrifices [d]acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.',
'2:6': 'For it is contained in Scripture: [a]&ldquo;Behold, I lay in Zion a [1]cornerstone, [2b]chosen <I>and</I> [3]precious; and he who [c]believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame.&rdquo;',
'2:7': 'To you therefore who believe is the [1]preciousness; but to the unbelieving, [a]&ldquo;The stone which the [2]builders [b]rejected, this has [3]become the head of the corner,&rdquo;',
'2:8': 'And, [a]&ldquo;A stone of [1b]stumbling and a rock of [c]offense&rdquo;; who [d]stumble at [2]the word, being disobedient, to [3]which also they were [e]appointed.',
'2:9': 'But you are a [a]chosen [1]race, a [2]royal [b]priesthood, a [3]holy nation, a people acquired for a possession, so that you may [4]tell out the [5c]virtues of Him who has [d]called you out of [6e]darkness into His marvelous [6f]light;',
'2:10': '[1]Who once were [a]not a people but now are the people of God; who had not <I>previously</I> been shown mercy but have now been shown mercy.',
'2:11': 'Beloved, I entreat <I>you</I> as [a]strangers and [b]sojourners to [c]abstain from [1d]fleshly lusts, which [e]war against the [1f]soul,',
'2:12': 'Having your [1a]manner of life [2b]excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the matter concerning which they [c]speak against you as evildoers they may, by your [d]good works, as they see <I>them</I> with their own eyes, [e]glorify God in the day of <I>His</I> [3f]visitation.',
'2:13': '[1]Be [a]subject to every human [2]institution [3]for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, whether to a [b]king as being supreme,',
'2:14': 'Or to governors as being sent by him for [a]vengeance on evildoers and praise of those who do [b]good.',
'2:15': 'For so is the [a]will of God, that by doing good you would muzzle the [b]ignorance of [1]foolish men;',
'2:16': 'As [a]free, and yet [b]not having freedom as a covering for evil, but as [c]slaves of God.',
'2:17': '[a]Honor all men. [b]Love the [1]brotherhood. [c]Fear God. Honor the [d]king.',
'2:18': 'Household [a]servants, be subject in all [1b]fear to your masters, not only to the good and forbearing but also to the crooked.',
'2:19': 'For this is [1]grace, if anyone, [2]because of a [a]consciousness of God, bears sorrows by suffering [3]unjustly.',
'2:20': 'For what [1]glory is it if, while sinning and being buffeted, you endure? But if, while doing good and [a]suffering, you endure, this is grace with God.',
'2:21': 'For to [1]this you were [a]called, because Christ also [b]suffered on your behalf, leaving you a [2c]model so that you may follow in His steps;',
'2:22': 'Who committed no [a]sin, nor was guile found in His [b]mouth;',
'2:23': 'Who being reviled did [a]not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten but kept committing [1]<I>all</I> to Him who [2b]judges righteously;',
'2:24': 'Who Himself [1a]bore up our sins in His [b]body on the [2c]tree, in order that we, [3]having [d]died to sins, might [4e]live [5]to righteousness; by whose [6f]bruise you were [7]healed.',
'2:25': 'For you were like [a]sheep being led astray, but you have now [1]returned to the [2b]Shepherd and [c]Overseer of your [3d]souls.',
'3:1': 'In [1]like manner, [a]wives, be subject to your own husbands, that even if any disobey the [2]word, they will be gained without the [2]word through the manner of life of their [b]wives,',
'3:2': 'Seeing with their own eyes your [1]pure manner of life [2]in [3a]fear.',
'3:3': 'Let your [a]adorning not be the outward [1]plaiting of hair and putting on of [b]gold or clothing with garments,',
'3:4': 'But the [1]hidden man of the [a]heart in the incorruptible <I>adornment</I> of a meek and quiet [b]spirit, which is very [c]costly in the sight of God.',
'3:5': 'For in this manner formerly the holy women also, who [a]hoped in God, adorned themselves, being [b]subject to their own husbands,',
'3:6': 'As Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him [a]lord; whose children you have become, if you do good and do not [b]fear any [1]terror.',
'3:7': '[a]Husbands, in like manner dwell together with <I>them</I> [1]according to knowledge, as with the [2]weaker, female [3]vessel, [4]assigning [b]honor to <I>them</I> as also to [c]fellow heirs of the [5]grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.',
'3:8': 'And finally be all of the [a]same mind, sympathetic, [b]loving the brothers, [c]tenderhearted, [d]humble-minded;',
'3:9': 'Not rendering [a]evil for evil or [b]reviling for reviling, but on the contrary [1c]blessing <I>one</I> <I>another</I>, because you were [d]called [2]to this, that you might inherit [e]blessing.',
'3:10': 'For [a]&ldquo;he who desires to love life and see [1]good days, let him cause his [b]tongue to cease from evil and <I>his</I> lips to speak no guile.',
'3:11': 'And let him [a]turn away from evil and do good; let him [b]seek peace and pursue it;',
'3:12': 'For the [a]eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His [b]ears <I>incline</I> to their petition; but the [c]face of the Lord is against those who do evil.&rdquo;',
'3:13': 'And who will harm you if you become zealous for what is [a]good?',
'3:14': 'But even if you [a]suffer because of [b]righteousness, you are [c]blessed. And do not be [d]afraid <I>with</I> fear from them, nor be [e]troubled,',
'3:15': 'But [1a]sanctify Christ as [b]Lord in your hearts, being always ready for a defense to everyone who asks of you an account concerning the [2c]hope which is in you,',
'3:16': 'Yet with [a]meekness and [1b]fear, having a good [2c]conscience, so that in the matter in which you are [d]spoken against, those who [e]revile your good [f]manner of life [3g]in Christ may be put to [h]shame.',
'3:17': 'For it is better, if the [a]will of God should will <I>it</I>, to [b]suffer for doing good than for doing evil.',
'3:18': 'For Christ also has suffered once for [1]sins, the Righteous [2a]on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you [b]to God, on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the [3]Spirit;',
'3:19': 'In [1]which also He went and [2]proclaimed to the [3]spirits in [4]prison,',
'3:20': '[1]Who had formerly disobeyed when the long-suffering of God waited in the days of [a]Noah, while the ark was being prepared; <I>entering</I> into which, a few, that is, eight souls, were [2]brought safely through [3]by [b]water.',
'3:21': '[1]Which <I>water</I>, as the antitype, also now saves you, <I>that</I> <I>is</I>, [2]baptism, [3]not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the [4]appeal of a good [a]conscience unto God, through the [b]resurrection of Jesus Christ,',
'3:22': '[1]Who is at the [a]right hand of God, having gone into [b]heaven, [c]angels and [d]authorities and powers being [e]subjected to Him.',
'4:1': 'Since Christ therefore has [a]suffered[1] in the flesh, you also [2b]arm yourselves with the [3]same mind (because he who has [4]suffered in the flesh has ceased from [c]sin),',
'4:2': '[1a]No longer to [b]live the rest of the time in the flesh in the [c]lusts of men, but in the [d]will of God.',
'4:3': 'For the time which has passed is [a]sufficient <I>for</I> <I>you</I> to have carried out the [1]desire of the [b]Gentiles, having gone on [2]in licentiousness, lusts, debaucheries, carousings, drinking bouts, and lawless idolatries.',
'4:4': 'In this they think it [1]strange that you are not [2]running together with <I>them</I> into the same [3]flood of [a]dissoluteness, [4]slandering <I>you</I>;',
'4:5': '[1]Who will [2a]render an account to [b]Him who is ready to [3]judge the living and the dead.',
'4:6': 'For unto this <I>end</I> the gospel was announced also to [1]<I>those</I> <I>who</I> <I>are</I> <I>now</I> dead, that they might be [2a]judged in the flesh according to men but live in the [3]spirit according to God.',
'4:7': 'But the [1]end of all things has drawn [a]near. Therefore [2]be sober-minded and [3]be [b]sober unto [c]prayers.',
'4:8': 'Above all, have [a]fervent love among yourselves, because [b]love [c]covers a multitude of sins.',
'4:9': 'Be [a]hospitable to one another without [b]murmuring,',
'4:10': '[a]Each one, as he has received a gift, [1]ministering it among yourselves as good [b]stewards of the [2]varied [c]grace of God.',
'4:11': 'If anyone speaks, as <I>speaking</I> [1a]oracles of God; if anyone ministers, as <I>ministering</I> out of the strength which God [2b]supplies; that in all things God may be [c]glorified [3]through Jesus Christ, [d]to whom is the [4]glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.',
'4:12': 'Beloved, do not think that the [1a]fiery ordeal among you, coming to you for a [2b]trial, is [3]strange, as if <I>it</I> <I>were</I> a [3]strange thing happening to you;',
'4:13': 'But inasmuch as you share in the [a]sufferings of Christ, [b]rejoice, so that also at the [c]revelation of His glory you may rejoice [d]exultingly.',
'4:14': 'If you are [a]reproached in the [1]name of [b]Christ, you are [c]blessed, because [2]the Spirit of glory and of God [3]rests upon you.',
'4:15': 'For let none of you [a]suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a [1b]meddler into others&rsquo; affairs;',
'4:16': 'But if as a [1a]Christian, let him not be [b]ashamed, but let him [2c]glorify God in this name.',
'4:17': 'For it is time for the [1a]judgment to [b]begin from the [2]house of God; and if [c]first from us, [3]what will be the end of those who [4d]disobey the gospel of God?',
'4:18': 'And if the [1]righteous man is [2]saved <I>only</I> with difficulty, where will the [a]ungodly and the sinner [3]appear?',
'4:19': 'So then let those [1]also who [a]suffer according to the [2b]will of God [3c]commit their [4]souls in [5d]well-doing to a faithful [6e]Creator.',
'5:1': '[1]Therefore the [2a]elders among you I exhort, who am a [3]fellow elder and [4b]witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a [5]partaker of the [c]glory to be revealed:',
'5:2': '[1a]Shepherd the [2b]flock of God among you, [3c]overseeing not under compulsion but [d]willingly, [4]according to God; not by [e]seeking gain through base means but eagerly;',
'5:3': 'Nor as [1a]lording it over your [2]allotments but by [3]becoming [b]patterns of the [4]flock.',
'5:4': 'And when the Chief [a]Shepherd is manifested, you will receive the [1b]unfading [c]crown of glory.',
'5:5': 'In like manner, [a]younger men, be [b]subject to [1]elders; and all of you [2]gird yourselves with [3c]humility toward one another, because God [4d]resists the [5e]proud but [f]gives [6g]grace to the [7h]humble.',
'5:6': 'Therefore [a]be [1b]humbled under the mighty [c]hand of God that He may [2d]exalt you in due time,',
'5:7': '[1a]Casting [2]all your [3b]anxiety on Him because [4]it matters to Him concerning you.',
'5:8': 'Be [1a]sober; [2b]watch. Your [3c]adversary, the [4d]devil, as a [5]roaring [e]lion, [6f]walks about, [7]seeking someone to devour.',
'5:9': 'Him [1a]withstand, being [b]firm in your [2]faith, knowing that the same [3c]sufferings are being accomplished among your [4]brotherhood in the world.',
'5:10': '[1a]But the God of [2]all grace, He who has [b]called you [3]into His [c]eternal glory [4d]in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a [e]little while, will [5]Himself [6f]perfect, [7g]establish, [8h]strengthen, <I>and</I> [9i]ground <I>you</I>.',
'5:11': '[a]To Him be [1]the glory and the might forever and ever. Amen.',
'5:12': 'Through [a]Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I account <I>him</I>, I have written to you briefly, [b]exhorting and [1c]testifying fully that this is the [2]true grace of God; <I>enter</I> into this <I>grace</I> and [d]stand <I>in</I> <I>it</I>.',
'5:13': 'The [1]co-[a]chosen in [2]Babylon and [3]Mark my son greet you.',
'5:14': 'Greet one another with a [a]kiss of love. [1b]Peace to you all who are [2c]in <I>Christ</I>.',

Hence, these two books emphasize the believers&rsquo; being chosen ({1Pe2:9|2:9}; {1Pe5:13|5:13}; {2Pe1:10|2&nbsp;Pet. 1:10}).

Anything and everything that happens to them, whether persecution or any other kind of trial or suffering ({1Pe1:6|v. 6}; {1Pe5:9|5:9}), is just a part of God&rsquo;s precious governmental dealing.

In this stage God justified us through the redemption of Christ ({Rom3:24|Rom. 3:24}-{Rom3:26|26}) and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit ({Joh3:3|John 3:3}-{Joh3:6|6}).

This initial salvation has saved us from God&rsquo;s condemnation and from eternal perdition ({Joh3:18|John 3:18}, {Joh3:16|16}).","(2) The progressing stage, the stage of transformation, which is composed of freedom from sin, sanctification (mainly dispositional&mdash;{Rom6:19|Rom. 6:19}, {Rom6:22|22}), growth in life, transformation, building up, and maturing. In this stage God is freeing us from the dominion of indwelling sin&mdash;the law of sin and of death&mdash;by the law of the Spirit of life, through the subjective working of the effectiveness of the death of Christ in us ({Rom6:6|Rom. 6:6}-{Rom6:7|7}; {Rom7:16|7:16}-{Rom7:20|20}; {Rom8:2|8:2}); sanctifying us by His Holy Spirit ({Rom15:16|Rom. 15:16}), with His holy nature, through His discipline ({Heb12:10|Heb. 12:10}) and His judgment in His own house ({1Pe4:17|4:17}); causing us to grow in His life ({1Co3:6|1&nbsp;Cor. 3:6}-{1Co3:7|7}); transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit ({2Co3:6|2&nbsp;Cor. 3:6}, {2Co3:17|17}-{2Co3:18|18}; {Rom12:2|Rom. 12:2}; {Eph4:23|Eph. 4:23}) through the working of all things ({Rom8:28|Rom. 8:28}); building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling ({1Pe2:5|2:5}; {Eph2:22|Eph. 2:22}); and maturing us in His life ({Rev14:15|Rev. 14:15} and {Rev14:15^1|notes}) for the completion of His full salvation. In this way we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, self, the soul (the natural life), and individualism into maturity in the divine life for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.","(3) The completing stage, the stage of glorification, which is composed of the redemption (transfiguration) of our body, conformity to the Lord, glorification, the inheritance of God&rsquo;s kingdom, participation in Christ&rsquo;s kingship, and the topmost enjoyment of the Lord. In this stage God will redeem our fallen and corrupted body ({Rom8:23|Rom. 8:23}) by transfiguring it into the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory ({Phi3:21|Phil. 3:21}); conform us to the glorious image of His firstborn Son ({Rom8:29|Rom. 8:29}), making us wholly and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body; and glorify us ({Rom8:30|Rom. 8:30}), immersing us in His glory ({Heb2:10|Heb. 2:10}) that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom ({2Ti4:18|2&nbsp;Tim. 4:18}; {2Pe1:11|2&nbsp;Pet. 1:11}), into which He has called us ({1Th2:12|1&nbsp;Thes. 2:12}), and inherit it as the topmost portion of His blessing ({Jam2:5|James 2:5}; {Gal5:21|Gal. 5:21})&mdash;even that we may reign with Christ as His co-kings, participating in His kingship over the nations ({2Ti2:12|2&nbsp;Tim. 2:12}; {Rev20:4|Rev. 20:4}, {Rev20:6|6}; {Rev2:26|2:26}-{Rev2:27|27}; {Rev12:5|12:5}) and sharing His royal, kingly joy in His divine government ({Mat25:21|Matt. 25:21}, {Mat25:23|23}).

Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved. Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more accusation and that instead we are full of peace and are confident that we have been baptized into the Triune God ({Mat28:19|Matt. 28:19}) and have been organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life.
