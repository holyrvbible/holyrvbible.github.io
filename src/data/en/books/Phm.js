'1:2': 'And to [1]Apphia the [a]sister and to [1b]Archippus our [c]fellow soldier and to the [2d]church, which is in your house:',
'1:3': 'Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.',
'1:4': 'I [a]thank my God always, making [b]mention of you in my prayers,',
'1:5': 'Hearing of your [1]love and the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and to all the saints,',
'1:6': 'That the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the [1]full [a]knowledge of [2]every good thing which is in [3]you [4]for Christ.',
'1:7': '[1]For I had much [a]joy and [b]encouragement over your love, because the [2c]inward parts of the saints have been [3d]refreshed through you, [e]brother.',
'1:8': 'Therefore though I have much [a]boldness in Christ to [b]charge you what is [c]fitting,',
'1:9': 'Because of love I rather [a]entreat, being such a one as Paul [1]the aged and now also a [2b]prisoner of Christ Jesus.',
'1:10': 'I entreat you concerning my [a]child, whom I have [1b]begotten in my [c]bonds, [2d]Onesimus,',
'1:11': 'Who formerly was [1]useless to you but now is [2]useful both to you and to me.',
'1:12': 'Him I have sent back to you&mdash;him, that is, my [1]very heart&mdash;',
'1:13': 'Whom I intended to keep with myself that on your behalf he might minister to me in the [a]bonds of the gospel.',
'1:14': 'But [1]without your mind I did not want to do anything, that your goodness would [a]not be as of necessity, but [b]voluntary.',
'1:15': '[1]For [2]perhaps for this reason he was separated <I>from</I> <I>you</I> for but an hour, that you might [3]fully have him forever,',
'1:16': '[1]No longer as a [a]slave, but [2]above a slave, a [3]beloved [b]brother, especially to me, but how much more to you, [4]both [c]in the flesh and in the Lord.',
'1:17': 'If then [1]you hold me as a [2a]partner, receive him as myself.',
'1:18': 'And if he has [1]wronged you in anything or owes <I>anything</I>, charge that to [2]my account.',
'1:19': 'I, Paul, have written with my [a]own hand: I will [1]repay; not to say to you that you owe me even [2]your own self besides.',
'1:20': 'Yes, [a]brother, may I have [1]profit from you in the Lord; [2b]refresh my [3]inward parts in Christ.',
'1:21': 'Having [a]confidence in your obedience, I have written to you, knowing that you will do even beyond the things that I say.',
'1:22': 'And at the same time also prepare me a [a]lodging, for I [1]hope that through your [b]prayers I will be [2]graciously [c]given to you.',
'1:23': '[1a]Epaphras, my [b]fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you;',
'1:24': '<I>As</I> <I>do</I> [a]Mark, [b]Aristarchus, [c]Demas, [d]Luke, my [e]fellow workers.',
'1:25': 'The [1a]grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your [2b]spirit. [3]',

The apostle appreciated the fellowship of Philemon&rsquo;s faith ({Phm6|v. 6}) and was encouraged by his love ({Phm7|v. 7}); thus, he entreated Philemon to receive Onesimus because of this love ({Phm9|v. 9}).

{sup:1, word:"No", lines:["This short Epistle serves the special purpose of showing us the equality, in God&rsquo;s eternal life and divine love, of all the members in the Body of Christ. In the semisavage age of Paul, the life of Christ had annulled, among the believers, the strong institution of slavery. Since the sentiment of the love of the Christian fellowship was so powerful and prevailing that the evil social order among fallen mankind was spontaneously ignored, any need for institutional emancipation was obviated. Because of the divine birth and because they were living by the divine life, all the believers in Christ had equal status in the church, which was the new man in Christ and in which there was no discrimination between free and bond ({Col3:10|Col. 3:10}-{Col3:11|11}). This was based on three facts: (1) Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life, for the creating of the one new man ({Eph2:15|Eph. 2:15}); (2) we all were baptized into Christ and were made one in Him without any differences ({Gal3:27|Gal. 3:27}-{Gal3:28|28}); and (3) in the new man Christ is all and in all ({Col3:11|Col. 3:11}). Such a life with such a love in equal fellowship is well able to maintain good order in the church (in Titus), carry out God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church (in 1&nbsp;Timothy), and stand against the tide of the church&rsquo;s decline (in 2&nbsp;Timothy). It is of the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty that in the arrangement of the New Testament this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books."]},
