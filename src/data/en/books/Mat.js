'1:16': 'And [1]Jacob begot [2a]Joseph the husband of [3b]Mary, of whom was [c]born [d]Jesus, who is called [4e]Christ.',
'1:17': 'Thus [1]all the generations from Abraham [2]until David are fourteen generations, and from David [3]until the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon [4]until the Christ, fourteen generations.',
'1:18': 'Now the [a]origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, [b]Mary, after she had been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with child [1]of the [c]Holy Spirit.',
'1:19': 'And Joseph her husband, being [1a]righteous and not willing to [b]disgrace her openly, intended to [2]send her away secretly.',
'1:20': 'But while he pondered these things, behold, an [a]angel of the Lord appeared to him in a [b]dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife, for that which has been [1]begotten in her is [2]of the [c]Holy Spirit.',
'1:21': 'And she will bear a [a]son, and you shall call His name [1b]Jesus, for <I>it</I> <I>is</I> He <I>who</I> will [c]save His people from their sins.',
'1:22': 'Now all this has happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the [1]prophet might be [a]fulfilled, saying,',
'1:23': '&ldquo;Behold, the [a]virgin shall be with child and shall bear a [1]son, and they shall call His name [2b]Emmanuel&rdquo; (which is translated, [c]God [3]with us).',
'1:24': 'And when Joseph awoke from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took to himself his wife.',
'1:25': 'And he did not know her until she [1]bore a son. And he called His name [a]Jesus.',
'2:1': 'Now after Jesus was [a]born in [1b]Bethlehem of Judea in the days of [c]Herod the king, behold, [d]magi from the [e]east arrived in Jerusalem,',
'2:2': 'Saying, Where is He who has been born [1a]King of the Jews? For we saw His [2b]star at its rising and have come to [c]worship Him.',
'2:3': 'And when Herod the king heard <I>this</I>, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.',
'2:4': 'And gathering together all the chief [1a]priests and [b]scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.',
'2:5': 'And they said to him, In [a]Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written through the prophet:',
'2:6': '[a]&ldquo;And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, by no means are you the least among the [1]princes of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a [b]Ruler, One who will [c]shepherd My people Israel.&rdquo;',
'2:7': 'Then Herod, secretly calling the magi, determined accurately from them the time that the star appeared.',
'2:8': 'And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go and find out accurately about the child. And when you find <I>Him</I>, report to me, so that I also may come and worship Him.',
'2:9': 'And after they heard the king, they went their way, and behold, the [1a]star which they saw at its rising led them until it came and stood over <I>the</I> <I>place</I> where the child was.',
'2:10': 'And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly <I>with</I> great joy.',
'2:11': 'And they came into the [1]house and saw the [a]child with [b]Mary His mother. And falling down, they [2]worshipped Him; and opening their treasures, they offered [3c]gifts to Him, [d]gold and [e]frankincense and [f]myrrh.',
'2:12': 'And because they had been divinely instructed in a [a]dream not to [1]return to Herod, they departed by [2]another way to their country.',
'2:13': 'Now when they had departed, behold, an [a]angel of the Lord appeared in a [b]dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and flee into [c]Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is going to seek the child to destroy Him.',
'2:14': 'And he arose and took the child and His mother by night and departed into Egypt,',
'2:15': 'And was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be [1a]fulfilled, saying, [b]&ldquo;Out of Egypt I called My [2c]Son.&rdquo;',
'2:16': 'Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, became greatly enraged, and sending out <I>men</I>, he [1]did away with all the boys who were in Bethlehem and in all its borders from two years old and under, according to the time that he had accurately determined from the magi.',
'2:17': 'At that time what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was [a]fulfilled, saying,',
'2:18': '[a]&ldquo;A voice in Ramah was heard, weeping and great lamentation: [1]Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, because they are no more.&rdquo;',
'2:19': 'And when Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a [a]dream to Joseph in Egypt,',
'2:20': 'Saying, Arise, take the child and His mother and go into the land of Israel, for those who seek the [1]life of the child have [a]died.',
'2:21': 'And he arose and took the child and His mother and entered into the land of Israel.',
'2:22': 'But because he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a [a]dream, he departed into the regions of [1b]Galilee.',
'2:23': 'And he came and settled in a city called [1a]Nazareth, so that what was spoken through the [2]prophets might be [b]fulfilled, He shall be called a [3]Nazarene.',
'3:1': 'Now in those days [1a]John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the [2b]wilderness of Judea',
'3:2': 'And saying, [1a]Repent, for the [2b]kingdom of the heavens has [3]drawn near.',
'3:3': 'For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, [a]&ldquo;A voice of one crying in the [1]wilderness, [2b]Prepare the way of the Lord; [2]make straight His paths.&rdquo;',
'3:4': 'Now this John had his garment of [1a]camel&rsquo;s hair and a [b]leather girdle around his loins, and his food was [1c]locusts and wild honey.',
'3:5': 'At that time [a]Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the [b]Jordan went out to him,',
'3:6': 'And they were [1a]baptized by him in the [2b]Jordan River as they [c]confessed their sins.',
'3:7': 'But when he saw many of the [1a]Pharisees and [2b]Sadducees coming to his [c]baptism, he said to them, Offspring of [d]vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming [e]wrath?',
'3:8': 'Produce then fruit [a]worthy of your repentance.',
'3:9': 'And do not presume to say within yourselves, We have [a]Abraham as <I>our</I> father; for I tell you that God is able, out of these [b]stones, to [1]raise up [c]children to Abraham.',
'3:10': 'And already the axe is laid at the root of the trees. Every [a]tree therefore that does not produce good fruit is cut down and cast into the [b]fire.',
'3:11': 'I baptize you in [a]water unto [b]repentance, but [c]He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose [d]sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy [e]Spirit and [1f]fire,',
'3:12': 'Whose [a]winnowing fan is in His hand. And He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will [b]gather His [1]wheat into the barn, but the [1]chaff He will burn up with unquenchable [c]fire.',
'3:13': 'Then Jesus came from [a]Galilee to the Jordan to John to be [1b]baptized by him.',
'3:14': 'But John tried to prevent Him, saying, It is I <I>who</I> have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?',
'3:15': 'But Jesus answered and said to him, Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to [a]fulfill all [1]righteousness. Then he permitted Him.',
'3:16': 'And [1]having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and behold, the [2]heavens were [a]opened to Him, and He saw the [3]Spirit of God descending like a [4b]dove and coming [c]upon Him.',
'3:17': 'And behold, a [a]voice out of the heavens, saying, [1]This is My [b]Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My [c]delight.',
'4:1': 'Then [1]Jesus was led up into the [a]wilderness by the Spirit to be [2b]tempted by the [3c]devil.',
'4:2': 'And when He had [a]fasted [1b]forty days and forty nights, afterward He became [c]hungry.',
'4:3': 'And the [1a]tempter came and said to Him, If You are the [2b]Son of God, speak that these [3]stones may become loaves of bread.',
'4:4': 'But He answered and said, [1]It is written, [2a]&ldquo;Man shall not live on [3]bread alone, but on every [4b]word that proceeds out through the [5]mouth of God.&rdquo;',
'4:5': 'Then the devil took Him into the [a]holy city and set Him on the [1]wing of the [2b]temple,',
'4:6': 'And said to Him, If You are the [a]Son of God, [1]cast Yourself down; for [2]it is written, [b]&ldquo;To His angels He shall give charge concerning You, and on <I>their</I> hands they shall bear You up, lest You strike Your foot against a stone.&rdquo;',
'4:7': 'Jesus said to him, [1]Again, it is written, [a]&ldquo;You shall not [2]test the Lord your God.&rdquo;',
'4:8': 'Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the [1a]kingdoms of the [b]world and their [c]glory.',
'4:9': 'And he said to Him, [1]All these will I give You if You will fall down and [a]worship me.',
'4:10': 'Then Jesus said to him, Go away, [1a]Satan! For it is written, [b]&ldquo;You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him [2c]only shall you serve.&rdquo;',
'4:11': 'Then the devil [1]left Him, and behold, [2a]angels came and ministered to Him.',
'4:12': 'Now when He heard that [a]John was delivered up, He [1]withdrew into [b]Galilee.',
'4:13': 'And leaving [a]Nazareth, He came and dwelt in [b]Capernaum, which is beside the sea in the borders of [c]Zebulun and [d]Naphtali,',
'4:14': 'In order that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,',
'4:15': '[a]&ldquo;Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the way to the sea, beyond the Jordan, [1]Galilee of the Gentiles:',
'4:16': 'The people sitting in darkness have seen a [1]great [a]light; and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light has risen.&rdquo;',
'4:17': 'From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, [1a]Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.',
'4:18': 'And while He was walking [a]beside the [1]Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, [b]Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, [2]casting a [3]net into the sea, for they were fishermen.',
'4:19': 'And He said to them, [a]Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.',
'4:20': 'And immediately leaving the nets, they [1a]followed Him.',
'4:21': 'And going on from there, He saw another two brothers, James the <I>son</I> of Zebedee and [a]John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, [1]mending their nets; and He [b]called them.',
'4:22': 'And immediately leaving the boat and their father, they [1a]followed Him.',
'4:23': 'And Jesus went about in all of Galilee, teaching in their [1a]synagogues and proclaiming the [2b]gospel of the kingdom and [c]healing every disease and every sickness among the people.',
'4:24': 'And the report concerning Him went out into all of Syria; and they brought to Him all who were ill, those afflicted with various diseases and torments and those [a]possessed by demons and epileptics and paralytics; and He healed them.',
'4:25': 'And great [1a]crowds followed Him from Galilee and [2]Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and <I>from</I> beyond the Jordan.',
'5:1': 'And when He saw the [a]crowds, He [1]went up to the [b]mountain. And after He sat down, His [2]disciples came to Him.',
'5:2': 'And [a]opening His mouth, He taught them, saying,',
'5:3': '[1]Blessed are the [2a]poor in [3]spirit, for theirs is the [4b]kingdom of the heavens.',
'5:4': 'Blessed are those who [1a]mourn, for they shall be [2b]comforted.',
'5:5': 'Blessed are the [1a]meek, for they shall [2b]inherit the earth.',
'5:6': 'Blessed are those who hunger and [a]thirst for [1b]righteousness, for they shall be [2c]satisfied.',
'5:7': 'Blessed are the [1a]merciful, for they shall be [2]shown mercy.',
'5:8': 'Blessed are the [1a]pure in heart, for they shall [2b]see God.',
'5:9': 'Blessed are the [1a]peacemakers, for they shall be called the [2b]sons of God.',
'5:10': 'Blessed are those who are [1a]persecuted for the sake of [b]righteousness, for [2]theirs is the [c]kingdom of the heavens.',
'5:11': 'Blessed are you when they [1a]reproach and [b]persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every [c]evil thing against you [2]because of Me.',
'5:12': '[a]Rejoice and exult, for your [1b]reward is great in the heavens; for so they [c]persecuted the [2]prophets who were before you.',
'5:13': '[1]You are the [2a]salt of the earth. But if the salt has become [3b]tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is [c]no longer good for anything except to be [4d]cast out and [5]trampled underfoot by men.',
'5:14': 'You are the [1a]light of the world. It is impossible for a [2b]city situated upon a mountain to be hidden.',
'5:15': 'Nor do <I>men</I> light a [a]lamp and place it under the [1]bushel, but on the [2b]lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house.',
'5:16': 'In the same way, let your light [a]shine before men, so that they may see your [1b]good works and [2c]glorify your [3]Father who is in the heavens.',
'5:17': '[1]Do not think that I have come to abolish the [a]law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to [2b]fulfill.',
'5:18': 'For truly I say to you, Until [1a]heaven and earth pass away, one [2]iota or one [3]serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass.',
'5:19': 'Therefore whoever annuls one of the [a]least of these [1]commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the [b]least in the [c]kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches <I>them</I>, he shall be called [d]great in the kingdom of the heavens.',
'5:20': 'For I say to you that unless your [1a]righteousness surpasses that of the [2]scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means [3b]enter into the kingdom of the heavens.',
'5:21': 'You have heard that it was said to the ancients, [a]&ldquo;You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the [b]judgment.&rdquo;',
'5:22': 'But [1]I say to you that everyone who is [2a]angry with his [3]brother shall be liable to the [4b]judgment. And whoever says to his [3]brother, [5]Raca, shall be liable to <I>the</I> <I>judgment</I> <I>of</I> the [6c]Sanhedrin; and whoever says, [7]Moreh, shall be liable to the [8d]Gehenna of fire.',
'5:23': 'Therefore if you are offering your [1a]gift at the [2b]altar and there you remember that your [c]brother has [3]something against you,',
'5:24': 'Leave your gift there before the altar, and [1]first go and [2]be [a]reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.',
'5:25': 'Be well disposed [1]quickly toward your [2a]opponent at law, while you are with him [3]on the way, lest the opponent [4]deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.',
'5:26': 'Truly I say to you, You shall by no means [1]come out from there until you [a]pay the last [2]quadrans.',
'5:27': 'You have heard that it was said, [a]&ldquo;You shall not commit adultery.&rdquo;',
'5:28': 'But I say to you that everyone who [a]looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed [b]adultery with her in his [1c]heart.',
'5:29': 'So if your right [a]eye stumbles you, [1]pluck it out and cast <I>it</I> from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into [2b]Gehenna.',
'5:30': 'And if your right [a]hand stumbles you, [1]cut it off and cast <I>it</I> from you, for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to pass away into [b]Gehenna.',
'5:31': 'And it was said, [a]Whoever [1]divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.',
'5:32': 'But I say to you that [1]everyone who [a]divorces his wife, except for the cause of [2]fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.',
'5:33': 'Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, [1a]&ldquo;You shall not break an oath, but you shall [2b]render to the Lord your oaths.&rdquo;',
'5:34': 'But I tell you [a]not to swear at all; neither by [1b]heaven, because it is the throne of God;',
'5:35': 'Nor by the [a]earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the [b]city of the great King;',
'5:36': 'Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.',
'5:37': 'But let your word be, [1a]Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is [2]of [3]the [b]evil one.',
'5:38': 'You have heard that it was said, [a]&ldquo;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&rdquo;',
'5:39': 'But I tell you [a]not to resist him who is evil; rather whoever [b]slaps you on your right cheek, [1]turn to him the other also.',
'5:40': 'And to him who wishes to [a]sue you and take your [1]tunic, yield to him your cloak also;',
'5:41': 'And whoever compels you to go one [1]mile, go with him two.',
'5:42': 'To him who asks of you, [1a]give; and from him who wants to [b]borrow from you, do not turn away.',
'5:43': 'You have heard that it was said, [a]&ldquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your [b]enemy.&rdquo;',
'5:44': 'But I say to you, [a]Love your enemies, and [b]pray for those who [c]persecute you,',
'5:45': 'So that you may become [1a]sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to [b]rise on the evil and the good and [2]sends [c]rain on the just and the unjust.',
'5:46': 'For if you [a]love those who love you, what [1]reward do you have? Do not even the [2]tax collectors do the same?',
'5:47': 'And if you greet only your brothers, what better thing are you doing? Do not even the [a]Gentiles do the same?',
'5:48': 'You therefore shall be [1a]perfect [b]as your heavenly Father is perfect.',
'6:1': '[1]But take care not to do your [2]righteousness [3]before men in order to be [a]gazed at by them; otherwise, you have no reward with your [4]Father who is in the heavens.',
'6:2': 'Therefore when you [a]give alms, do not [1]sound a trumpet before you as the [2b]hypocrites do in the [3]synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be [c]glorified by men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.',
'6:3': 'But you, when you give alms, do not let your [1]left hand know what your right hand is doing,',
'6:4': 'So that your alms may be in [1a]secret; and your Father who [2]sees in secret will [3b]repay you.',
'6:5': 'And when you pray, you shall not be like the [a]hypocrites, because they love to [b]pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, They have [1]their reward in full.',
'6:6': 'But you, when you pray, enter into your [1]private room, and [a]shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in [b]secret will repay you.',
'6:7': 'And in praying do [1]not babble empty words as the Gentiles do; for they suppose that in their [a]multiplicity of words they will be heard.',
'6:8': 'Therefore do not be like them, for your Father [a]knows the things that you have need of before you [1]ask Him.',
'6:9': '[a]You then pray [1]in this way: Our [b]Father who is in the heavens, [2]Your name be [c]sanctified;',
'6:10': 'Your [a]kingdom come; Your [b]will be done, as in heaven, <I>so</I> also on [1]earth.',
'6:11': '[1]Give us [2]today our [3]daily bread.',
'6:12': 'And [1a]forgive us our debts, as we also have [1]forgiven our debtors.',
'6:13': 'And do [1]not bring us into [a]temptation, but [b]deliver us from [2]the [c]evil one. [3]For Yours is the [4d]kingdom and the [e]power and the [f]glory forever. [5g]Amen.',
'6:14': '[1]For if you [a]forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also;',
'6:15': 'But if you do [a]not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses.',
'6:16': 'And when you [1a]fast, do not be like the sullen-faced hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they may [b]appear to men to be fasting. Truly I say to you, They have their reward in full.',
'6:17': 'But you, when you fast, [a]anoint your head and wash your face,',
'6:18': 'So that you may not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in [a]secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.',
'6:19': '[1]Do [a]not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where [b]moth and rust consume and where thieves dig through and steal.',
'6:20': 'But [1]store up for yourselves [a]treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not [b]dig through nor steal.',
'6:21': 'For where your treasure is, there will your [1a]heart be also.',
'6:22': 'The [a]lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is [1]single, your whole body will be full of light;',

'6:24': 'No one can [1]serve [a]two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will [2]hold to one and despise the other. You cannot [1]serve God and [3b]mammon.',
'6:25': 'Because of this, I say to you, [a]Do not be [b]anxious for your [1]life, what you should eat or what you should drink; nor for your body, what you should put on. Is not the [1]life [2]more than food, and the body than clothing?',
'6:26': 'Look at the [a]birds of heaven. They do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are you not of more value than they?',
'6:27': 'Who among you by being anxious can add one cubit to [1]his stature?',
'6:28': 'And why are you [a]anxious concerning [b]clothing? Consider well the [1c]lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil, neither do they spin <I>thread</I>.',
'6:29': 'But I tell you that not even [a]Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.',

'12:7': 'But if you knew what <I>this</I> means, [a]&ldquo;I desire mercy and not sacrifice,&rdquo; you would not have condemned the guiltless.',

'12:11': 'And He said to them, What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and [a]lift <I>it</I> out?',
'12:12': 'Of how much [a]more value then is a man than a sheep! So then it is [b]lawful to do well on the Sabbath.',
'12:13': 'Then He said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And he stretched <I>it</I> out and it was [1]restored, as sound as the other.',

'13:9': 'He who has [1a]ears to hear, let him hear.',
'13:10': '[a]And the disciples came and said to Him, Why do You speak in parables to them?',
'13:11': 'And He answered and said to them, Because to you it has been given to know the [1a]mysteries of the [b]kingdom of the heavens, but to them it has not been given.',
'13:12': 'For [1a]whoever has, it shall be given to him, and he will abound; but [2]whoever does not have, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.',
'13:13': 'For this reason I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do [a]not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.',
'13:14': 'And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says, [a]&ldquo;In hearing you shall hear and by no means understand, and seeing you shall see and by no means perceive.',

'13:16': 'But [a]blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear.',
'13:17': 'For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to [a]perceive the things that you [1]see, and have not perceived <I>them</I>, and to hear the things that you [1]hear, and have not heard <I>them</I>.',
'13:18': '[a]You therefore hear the parable of the one who sowed.',
'13:19': 'When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the [1a]evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is the one sown beside the way.',
'13:20': 'And the one sown on the rocky places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy;',
'13:21': 'Yet he does not have root in himself but lasts only for a time, and when affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately he is [a]stumbled.',
'13:22': 'And the one sown in the thorns, this is he who hears the word, and the [a]anxiety of the [b]age and the deceitfulness of [c]riches utterly choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.',
'13:23': 'But the one sown on the good earth, this is he who hears the word and understands, who by all means bears [a]fruit and produces, one a hundredfold, and one sixtyfold, and one thirtyfold.',
'13:24': 'Another parable He set before them, saying, The [1a]kingdom of the heavens has become like a [b]man sowing good [c]seed in his [c]field.',

'13:26': 'And when the blade sprouted and produced fruit, then the tares appeared also.',
'13:27': 'And the slaves of the master of the house came and said to him, Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? Where then did the tares come from?',
'13:28': 'And he said to them, An enemy has done this. And the slaves said to him, Do you want us then to go and [1]collect them?',
'13:29': 'But he said, No, lest while [1]collecting the tares, you uproot the wheat along with them.',
'13:30': 'Let both [1]grow together until the [a]harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, [b]Collect first the tares and bind them into bundles to [c]burn them up, but the [d]wheat gather into my barn.',
'13:31': '[a]Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a [1b]mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,',
'13:32': '<I>And</I> which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a [1]tree, so that the [2a]birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.',
'13:33': '[a]Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like [1b]leaven, which a [2c]woman took and hid in [d]three measures of [3]meal until the whole was leavened.',
'13:34': 'All these things Jesus spoke in [a]parables to the crowds, and apart from a parable He spoke nothing to them,',
'13:35': 'So that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying, [a]&ldquo;I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things [b]hidden [1c]from the foundation of the world.&rdquo;',
'13:36': 'Then, leaving the crowds, He went into the [a]house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, Make the [b]parable of the tares of the field clear to us.',
'13:37': 'And He answered and said, He who sows the good seed is the [a]Son of Man;',
'13:38': 'And the field is the world; and the [1]good seed, these are the [a]sons of the kingdom; and the [1]tares are the [b]sons of the evil one;',
'13:39': 'And the enemy who sowed them is the [a]devil; and the harvest is the [b]consummation of the age; and the reapers are angels.',
'13:40': 'Therefore just as the tares are collected and burned up with fire, so will it be at the consummation of the age.',
'13:41': 'The [a]Son of Man will send His angels, and they will collect out of [1]His [b]kingdom all the [c]stumbling blocks and those who practice [d]lawlessness,',
'13:42': 'And will cast them into the [1a]furnace of fire. In that place there will be the [2b]weeping and the gnashing of teeth.',
'13:43': 'Then the [1]righteous will [a]shine forth like the sun in the [2b]kingdom of their Father. He who has [c]ears to hear, let him hear.',
'13:44': 'The kingdom of the heavens is like a [1]treasure hidden in the [2a]field, which a [3]man found and [b]hid, and in his joy goes and sells all that he has, and [c]buys that field.',
'13:45': 'Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a [1]merchant seeking fine pearls;',
'13:46': 'And finding one [1a]pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and [b]bought it.',
'13:47': 'Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a [1a]net cast into the [2]sea and gathering from [3]every species,',
'13:48': 'Which, when it was filled, they brought onto the shore, and sat down and collected the [1]good into vessels; but the [1]foul they cast out.',

'13:50': 'And will cast them into the [1a]furnace of fire. In that place there will be the [2b]weeping and the gnashing of teeth.',
'13:51': 'Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes.',

'16:11': 'How is it that you do not understand that <I>it</I> <I>was</I> not about bread <I>that</I> I spoke to you? But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.',
'16:12': 'Then they understood that He did not say to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the [1]teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.',
'16:13': '[a]Now when Jesus came into the parts of [1]Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, Who do men say that the [2b]Son of Man is?',
'16:14': 'And they said, [1]Some, [a]John the Baptist; and others, [b]Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.',
'16:15': 'He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?',
'16:16': 'And Simon Peter answered and said, You are the [1a]Christ, the [1b]Son of the [2c]living God.',
'16:17': 'And Jesus answered and said to him, [a]Blessed are you, [b]Simon [1]Barjona, because [2c]flesh and blood has not [d]revealed <I>this</I> to you, but My [3]Father who is in the heavens.',
'16:18': 'And I [1]also say to you that you are [2a]Peter, and upon [3]this [b]rock I will [4c]build My [5d]church, and the [6e]gates of [f]Hades shall not prevail [g]against it.',
'16:19': 'I will give to you the [1a]keys of the [2]kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you [3b]bind on the earth shall [4]have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you [3]loose on the earth shall [4]have been loosed in the heavens.',
'16:20': 'Then He charged the disciples [1]not to tell [a]anyone that He was the Christ.',
'16:21': '[a]From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He [1]must go to [b]Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be [c]killed and on the third day be raised.',
'16:22': 'And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, <I>God</I> be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by [1]no means happen to You!',
'16:23': 'But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, [1a]Satan! [2]You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are [3]not setting your [b]mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.',
'16:24': 'Then Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him [1]deny [2]himself and take up his [3a]cross and [4]follow Me.',
'16:25': 'For whoever wants to save his [a]soul-life shall [1]lose it; but whoever [2]loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.',
'16:26': 'For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his [1]soul-life? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?',
'16:27': '[1]For the [a]Son of Man is to [b]come in the [c]glory of His Father with His [d]angels, and then He will [2e]repay each man according to his doings.',
'16:28': 'Truly I say to you, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man [1a]coming in His kingdom.',
'17:1': '[a]And after six days Jesus [b]took with <I>Him</I> Peter and James and John his brother, and [1]brought them up to a [2c]high mountain privately.',
'17:2': 'And He was [1a]transfigured before them, and His face shone like the [b]sun, and His garments became as [c]white as the light.',
'17:3': 'And behold, [1a]Moses and [b]Elijah appeared to them, conversing with Him.',
'17:4': 'And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make [1]three [a]tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah.',
'17:5': 'While he was still speaking, behold, a bright [a]cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a [b]voice out of the cloud, saying, [1]This is My Son, the [c]Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. [d]Hear [2]Him!',
'17:6': 'And when the disciples [a]heard <I>this</I>, they [b]fell on their face and were greatly frightened.',
'17:7': 'And Jesus came to <I>them</I> and [a]touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid.',
'17:8': 'And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw [1]no one except Jesus Himself alone.',
'17:9': '[a]And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the [1]vision to no one until the [b]Son of Man is [c]raised from the dead.',
'17:10': 'And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that [1a]Elijah must come first?',
'17:11': 'And He answered and said, [1]Elijah indeed is coming and will [a]restore all things;',
'17:12': 'But I say to you that [1a]Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but [b]did with him the things they wished. So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.',
'17:13': 'Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist.',
'17:14': '[a]And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying,',
'17:15': 'Lord, have mercy on my son, for he [1]has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water.',
'17:16': 'And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.',
'17:17': 'And Jesus answered and said, O [a]unbelieving and [b]perverted generation! How long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.',
'17:18': 'And Jesus [a]rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour.',
'17:19': 'Then the disciples, coming to Jesus privately, said, Why were we not able to cast it out?',
'17:20': 'And He said to them, Because of your [a]little faith; for truly I say to you, If you have faith like a [b]mustard seed, you will say to this [c]mountain, Move from here to there, and it will move; and nothing will be [d]impossible to you.',
'17:21': '[1]But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.',
'17:22': '[a]And while they [1]were gathering together in [b]Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men,',
'17:23': 'And they will [a]kill Him, and on the third day He will be raised. And they were greatly grieved.',
'17:24': 'And when they came to [a]Capernaum, those who take up the [1b]temple tax came to Peter and said, Does not your Teacher pay the [1]temple tax?',
'17:25': 'He said, [1]Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus [2]anticipated him, saying, What do you [a]think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?',
'17:26': 'And when he said, From strangers, Jesus said to him, So then the [1]sons are free.',
'17:27': 'But that we do not [a]stumble them, [1]go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a [2]stater; take that and [3]give <I>it</I> to them for Me [4]and you.',
'18:1': '[a]In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is [b]greatest [1]in the kingdom of the heavens?',
'18:2': 'And He called a little child to <I>Him</I> and stood him in their midst',
'18:3': 'And said, Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like [a]little children, you shall by no means [b]enter into the kingdom of the heavens.',
'18:4': 'He therefore who will [a]humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.',
'18:5': 'And whoever receives one such little child [1]because of My name, receives Me;',
'18:6': 'And whoever [a]stumbles one of these little ones who believe into Me, it is [1]<I>more</I> profitable for him that a [2]great [b]millstone be hung around his neck and he be drowned in the open sea.',
'18:7': 'Woe to the world because of [a]stumbling blocks! For it is necessary for stumbling blocks to come, but woe to that man through whom the stumbling block comes.',
'18:8': 'If your [a]hand or your foot stumbles you, [1]cut it off and cast <I>it</I> from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal [b]fire.',
'18:9': 'And if your [a]eye stumbles you, [1]pluck it out and cast <I>it</I> from you; it is better for you to enter into life with one eye than to have two eyes and be cast into the [2]Gehenna of fire.',
'18:10': 'See that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that their [a]angels in the heavens continually behold the face of My Father who is in the heavens.',
'18:11': '[1]For the Son of Man has come to save that which is lost.',
'18:12': '[a]What do you think? [b]If any man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, will he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and seek the one that has gone astray?',
'18:13': 'And if it so happens that he finds it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.',
'18:14': 'In the same way, it is not the will of [1]your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones [a]perish.',
'18:15': 'Moreover if your brother [a]sins against you, go, [1b]reprove him [2]between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother.',
'18:16': 'But if he does not hear <I>you</I>, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three [a]witnesses every word may be established.',
'18:17': 'And if he refuses to hear them, [1]tell <I>it</I> to the [2a]church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you [3]just like the [b]Gentile and the [c]tax collector.',
'18:18': 'Truly I say to you, Whatever you [1a]bind on the earth shall [2]have been bound in heaven, and whatever you [1]loose on the earth shall [2]have been loosed in heaven.',
'18:19': 'Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are [1]in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they [2]ask, [3]it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.',
'18:20': 'For where there are [1]two or three [2]gathered into My name, there am I in their [a]midst.',
'18:21': 'Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother [a]sin against me and I [b]forgive him? Up to [c]seven times?',
'18:22': 'Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven.',
'18:23': 'For this reason the kingdom of the heavens has become like a [1]king who desired to [2a]settle accounts with his slaves.',
'18:24': 'And when he began to settle <I>them</I>, one who owed him [1]ten thousand talents was brought to him.',
'18:25': 'But since he did not have <I>the</I> <I>means</I> to [a]repay, the master commanded him to be [b]sold, as well as his wife and children and all that he had, and repayment to be made.',
'18:26': 'Then the slave fell down and worshipped him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you all.',
'18:27': 'And the master of that slave was moved with compassion and released him and [1]forgave him the loan.',
'18:28': 'But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a [1]hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke <I>him</I>, saying, Repay <I>me</I> what you owe.',
'18:29': 'Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you.',
'18:30': 'But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.',
'18:31': 'Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly [1]grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.',
'18:32': 'Then his master called him to <I>him</I> and said to him, [a]Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.',
'18:33': 'Should you not also have had [a]mercy on your fellow slave even [b]as I had mercy on you?',
'18:34': 'And his master became angry and [1]delivered him to the torturers until he would [a]repay all that was owed.',
'18:35': 'So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does [a]not forgive his brother [b]from your hearts.',
'19:1': 'And when Jesus finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea [a]beyond the Jordan.',
'19:2': 'And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there.',
'19:3': '[a]And some Pharisees came to Him, [1b]testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to [2]divorce his wife for any cause?',
'19:4': 'And He answered and said, Have you [a]not read that [1]He who [b]created <I>them</I> from the beginning made them male and female,',
'19:5': 'And said, &ldquo;For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be [a]joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh&rdquo;?',
'19:6': 'So then they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not [a]separate.',
'19:7': 'They said to Him, Why then did Moses [1]command <I>us</I> to give <I>her</I> a [a]certificate of divorce and divorce her?',
'19:8': 'He said to them, Moses, because of your [a]hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the [1]beginning it has not been so.',
'19:9': 'But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for [1]fornication, and marries another, commits [a]adultery; [2]and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.',
'19:10': 'His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is [1]like this, it is not profitable to marry.',
'19:11': 'And He said to them, [1]Not all men <I>can</I> [2]accept this word, but <I>only</I> <I>those</I> to whom it has been [a]given.',
'19:12': 'For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother&rsquo;s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs [1]who made themselves eunuchs [a]because of the [2]kingdom of the heavens. He who can <I>accept</I> <I>it</I>, let him accept <I>it</I>.',
'19:13': '[a]Then little children were brought to Him that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples [b]rebuked them.',
'19:14': 'But Jesus said, Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for [a]of [1]such is the kingdom of the heavens.',
'19:15': 'And after He laid His hands on them, He went on from there.',
'19:16': '[a]And behold, someone came to Him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may [1]have [b]eternal life?',
'19:17': 'And He said to him, Why do you ask Me concerning what is good? There is <I>only</I> [1]One <I>who</I> <I>is</I> [2a]good. But if you want to [3b]enter into life, [4c]keep the commandments.',
'19:18': 'He said to Him, Which ones? And Jesus said, &ldquo;You shall [a]not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness;',
'19:19': '[a]Honor your father and mother; and you shall [b]love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;',
'19:20': 'The young man said to Him, All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?',
'19:21': 'Jesus said to him, If you want to be [1a]perfect, go, [b]sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have [c]treasure in the heavens; and come, [2d]follow Me.',
'19:22': 'But the young man, hearing this word, went away [1]sorrowing, for he had many possessions.',
'19:23': '[a]And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, <I>Only</I> with difficulty will a [b]rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens.',
'19:24': 'And again I say to you, It is [1]easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the [a]kingdom of [2]God.',
'19:25': 'And when the disciples heard <I>this</I>, they were greatly astonished and said, Who then can be [1]saved?',
'19:26': 'And looking upon <I>them</I>, Jesus said to them, With men this is [1]impossible, but with God all things are [1a]possible.',
'19:27': 'Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left all and [a]followed You. What then will there be for us?',
'19:28': 'And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the [1a]restoration, when the [b]Son of Man sits on the [c]throne of His glory, you also shall [d]sit on twelve thrones, [2e]judging the twelve tribes of Israel.',
'19:29': 'And everyone who has left houses or [a]brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name&rsquo;s sake shall [1]receive [2]a hundred times as much and shall [3]inherit [b]eternal life.',
'19:30': 'But many [1a]first will be last, and <I>many</I> last first.',
'20:1': '[1]For the kingdom of the heavens is like a [2]man, <I>who</I> <I>is</I> a householder, who went out early in the [3]morning to hire [4]workmen for his [5a]vineyard.',
'20:2': 'And having [1]agreed with the workmen for a [2]denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.',
'20:3': 'And he went out about the [1]third hour and saw others standing [2]idle in the [3]marketplace,',
'20:4': 'And to those he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.',
'20:5': 'And again he went out about the [1]sixth and the [2]ninth hour and did likewise.',
'20:6': 'And about the [1]eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and said to them, Why have you been standing here all the day idle?',
'20:7': 'They said to him, Because [1]no one has hired us. He said to them, You [2]also go into the vineyard.',
'20:8': 'And when [1]evening fell, the master of the vineyard said to his steward, Call the workmen and pay them their wages, beginning from the [2]last ones to the first.',
'20:9': 'And when those <I>hired</I> about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius.',
'20:10': 'And when the [1]first ones came, they supposed that they would receive more. And they themselves also received each a denarius.',
'20:11': 'And when they received <I>it</I>, they murmured against the householder,',
'20:12': '[1]Saying, These last ones worked one hour, and you have made them [2]equal to us who bore the burden of the day and the scorching heat.',
'20:13': 'But he answered [1]one of them and said, [2a]Friend, I am doing nothing unrighteous to you. Did you not [3]agree with me for a denarius?',
'20:14': '[1]Take what is yours and go. I [1]want to give to this last one even as I have given to you.',
'20:15': 'Is it not lawful for me to do what I [1]wish with what is mine? Or is your eye [2]evil because I am [1]good?',
'20:16': 'Thus shall the [1a]last be first and the first last.',
'20:17': '[a]And as Jesus was going up to [b]Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them,',
'20:18': 'Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes. And they will condemn Him to [1a]death,',
'20:19': 'And [a]deliver Him to the Gentiles to [b]mock and to scourge and to [c]crucify <I>Him</I>, and on the [d]third day He will be raised.',
'20:20': '[a]Then the mother of the [1]sons of [b]Zebedee came to Him with her sons, worshipping and asking something of Him.',
'20:21': 'And He said to her, What do you want? She said to Him, Say that these two sons of mine will [a]sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your kingdom.',
'20:22': 'But Jesus answered and said <I>to</I> <I>them</I>, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to [1]drink the [a]cup which I am about to drink? They said to Him, We are able.',
'20:23': 'He said to them, My cup you shall indeed [a]drink, but to sit on My right and on My left, this is [1]not Mine to give, but <I>it</I> <I>is</I> <I>for</I> those for whom it has been prepared by My Father.',
'20:24': 'And when the ten heard <I>this</I>, they were indignant concerning the two brothers.',
'20:25': '[a]But Jesus called them to <I>Him</I> and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great exercise authority over them.',
'20:26': 'It shall not be so among you; but whoever wants to become [a]great among you shall be your [1]servant,',
'20:27': 'And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your [1a]slave;',
'20:28': 'Just as the [a]Son of [1]Man did not come to be served, but to [b]serve and to give His [2]life as a [c]ransom for many.',
'20:29': '[a]And as they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed Him.',
'20:30': 'And behold, two [a]blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, [1b]Son of David!',
'20:31': 'And the crowd [a]rebuked them so that they would be silent, but they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!',
'20:32': 'And Jesus, standing still, called them and said, What do you want Me to do for you?',
'20:33': 'They said to Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.',
'20:34': 'And Jesus, moved with [a]compassion, touched their eyes, and immediately they received their sight and followed Him.',
'21:1': '[a]And when they [1]drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of [b]Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,',
'21:2': 'Saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will [1]find a donkey tied and a colt with her; untie <I>them</I> and lead <I>them</I> to Me.',
'21:3': 'And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, The [1]Lord has need of them; [2]and immediately he will send them.',
'21:4': '[a]Now this took place in order that what was spoken through the prophet might be [b]fulfilled, saying,',
'21:5': '[a]&ldquo;Say to the [1]daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, [b]meek and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, a [2]foal of a beast of burden.&rdquo;',
'21:6': 'And the disciples went and did as Jesus directed them,',
'21:7': 'And led the donkey and the colt. And they put their [1]garments on them, and He sat upon them.',
'21:8': 'And most of the crowd spread their own [a]garments in the road, and others cut [1b]branches from the trees and spread <I>them</I> in the road.',
'21:9': 'And the crowds who went before Him and those who followed cried out, saying, [1]Hosanna to the [2a]Son of David! [b]Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the [c]highest!',
'21:10': 'And when He [a]entered into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this?',
'21:11': 'And the crowds said, This is the [a]prophet Jesus from [b]Nazareth of Galilee.',
'21:12': '[a]And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all those who were selling and buying in the temple. And He overturned the tables of the [b]money changers and the seats of those who were selling the [c]doves,',
'21:13': 'And He said to them, It is written, [a]&ldquo;My house shall be called a house of prayer,&rdquo; but you are making it a [b]den of robbers.',
'21:14': 'And the [a]blind and the lame came to Him in the temple, and He healed them.',
'21:15': 'But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, [a]Hosanna to the Son of David, they were [1]indignant.',
'21:16': 'And they said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes. Have you [a]never read, [b]&ldquo;Out of the mouth of [c]infants and sucklings You have perfected praise&rdquo;?',
'21:17': 'And leaving them, He went [a]out of the city to [1b]Bethany and lodged there.',
'21:18': '[a]Now in the morning as He returned to the city, He became [1b]hungry.',
'21:19': 'And seeing a [1a]fig tree on the way, He came to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And He said to it, May there [2]no longer be fruit from you forever! And the fig tree was instantly [3]dried up.',
'21:20': 'And when the disciples saw <I>this</I>, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree instantly dry up?',
'21:21': 'And Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have [a]faith and do not [b]doubt, you will not only do what <I>was</I> <I>done</I> to the fig tree, but even if you say to this [c]mountain, Be taken up and cast into the sea, it will happen.',
'21:22': 'And all that you [a]ask in prayer, if you believe, you will receive.',
'21:23': '[a]And when He came into the temple, the chief priests and elders of the people came to Him as He was [b]teaching and said, By what authority do You do these things? And [c]who gave You this authority?',
'21:24': 'And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one [1]thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.',
'21:25': 'The baptism of John, from where did it <I>come</I>, from [a]heaven or from men? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?',
'21:26': 'But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a [a]prophet.',
'21:27': 'And they answered Jesus and said, We do [1]not know. He too said to them, [2]Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.',
'21:28': 'But what do you think? A man had two children. And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the [a]vineyard.',
'21:29': 'And he answered and said, I do not want to; yet later he regretted and went.',

'25:35': 'For I was [1]hungry and you gave Me <I>something</I> to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a [a]drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in,',
'25:36': 'Naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.',
'25:37': 'Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry and have fed <I>You</I>, or thirsty and have given <I>You</I> a drink?',
'25:38': 'And when have we seen You a stranger and have taken <I>You</I> in, or naked and have clothed <I>You</I>?',
'25:39': 'And when have we seen You sick or in prison and have come to You?',
'25:40': 'And the King will answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have [1]done <I>it</I> to one of [2]these, the [a]least of My [3b]brothers, you have done <I>it</I> to [4c]Me.',
'25:41': 'Then He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me, you who are cursed, into the [1a]eternal fire [2]prepared for the devil and his [b]angels.',
'25:42': 'For I was hungry and you did not give Me <I>anything</I> to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a drink;',
'25:43': 'I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; naked and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.',
'25:44': 'Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You?',
'25:45': 'Then He will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you [1]did not do <I>it</I> to one of the least of these, neither have you done <I>it</I> to [a]Me.',
'25:46': 'And these shall go away into eternal [1]punishment, but the [2]righteous [3a]into eternal life.',
'26:1': 'And when Jesus finished all these words, He said to His disciples,',
'26:2': 'You know that after two days the [1a]Passover takes place, and the Son of Man is being [b]delivered up to be crucified.',
'26:3': 'Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were [a]gathered together in the courtyard of the high priest, who was called [b]Caiaphas,',
'26:4': 'And they took [a]counsel together to [b]seize Jesus by craftiness and [c]kill <I>Him</I>.',
'26:5': 'But they said, [1]Not at the feast, lest there be an [a]uproar among the people.',
'26:6': '[a]Now when Jesus was in [b]Bethany, in the house of Simon the [1]leper,',
'26:7': 'A woman came to Him, having an alabaster flask of ointment of great value, and she poured <I>it</I> on His head as He reclined <I>at</I> <I>table</I>.',
'26:8': 'But when the disciples saw <I>it</I>, they were indignant, saying, Why this [1]waste?',
'26:9': 'For this could have been sold for much and given to the [a]poor.',
'26:10': 'But Jesus, knowing <I>it</I>, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a noble deed to Me.',
'26:11': 'For the [a]poor you have with you always, [1]but you do [b]not always have Me.',
'26:12': 'For in pouring out this ointment on My body, she has done <I>it</I> [1]for My [a]burial.',
'26:13': 'Truly I say to you, Wherever [1]this [a]gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, [2]what this woman has done shall also be told as a [b]memorial of her.',
'26:14': '[1a]At that time one of the twelve, the one called [b]Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests',
'26:15': 'And said, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver Him to you? And they weighed out to him [1a]thirty pieces of silver.',
'26:16': 'And from then on he sought opportunity to [a]deliver Him up.',
'26:17': '[a]Now on the first day of the [1b]<I>Feast</I> <I>of</I> Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the passover?',
'26:18': 'And He said, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, The [a]Teacher says, My [b]time is near. I am keeping the passover at your <I>house</I> with My disciples.',
'26:19': 'And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the passover.',
'26:20': '[a]And when evening fell, He reclined <I>at</I> <I>table</I> with the twelve.',
'26:21': 'And as they were eating, He said, Truly I say to you that [a]one of you will betray Me.',
'26:22': 'And being greatly grieved, each one of them began to say to Him, I am not <I>the</I> <I>one</I>, am I, Lord?',
'26:23': 'And He answered and said, The one who dips his hand with Me in the dish, this one will betray Me.',
'26:24': 'The Son of Man is going away, even as it is [a]written concerning Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.',
'26:25': 'And Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, I am not <I>the</I> <I>one</I>, am I, [a]Rabbi? He said to him, [1b]You have said <I>it</I> yourself.',
'26:26': '[a]And as they were [1]eating, Jesus took [2]bread and [b]blessed <I>it</I>, and He broke <I>it</I> and gave <I>it</I> to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My [2]body.',
'26:27': 'And He took a [1a]cup and gave [b]thanks, and He gave <I>it</I> to them, saying, Drink of it, all <I>of</I> <I>you</I>,',
'26:28': 'For this is My [1a]blood of the [2b]covenant, which is being poured out for [c]many for [d]forgiveness of sins.',
'26:29': 'But I say to you, I shall by no means drink of this [1]product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the [2a]kingdom of My Father.',
'26:30': '[a]And after [1]singing a hymn, they went out to the [b]Mount of Olives.',
'26:31': 'Then Jesus said to them, You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, &ldquo;I will [a]smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be [b]scattered.&rdquo;',
'26:32': 'But after I have been raised, I will go before you into [a]Galilee.',
'26:33': 'Then Peter answered and said to Him, If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled.',
'26:34': 'Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you that in this night, before a [a]rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.',
'26:35': 'Peter said to Him, Even if I must [a]die with You, I will by no means deny You. And all the disciples said likewise.',
'26:36': '[a]Then Jesus came with them to a [b]place called [1]Gethsemane, and He said to the disciples, Sit here while I go over there and pray.',
'26:37': 'And taking Peter and the two [a]sons of Zebedee aside, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.',
'26:38': 'Then He said to them, My [a]soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch with Me.',
'26:39': 'And going forward a little, He fell on His face and [a]prayed, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this [1b]cup pass from Me; yet not as I [c]will, but as You <I>will</I>.',
'26:40': 'And He came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And He said to Peter, So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?',
'26:41': '[a]Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The [1]spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.',
'26:42': 'Again, going away a second time, He prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your [a]will be done.',
'26:43': 'And coming again, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.',
'26:44': 'And leaving them, He went away again and prayed a [a]third time, saying the same word again.',
'26:45': 'Then He came to the disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the [a]hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.',
'26:46': 'Arise, let us be going. Behold, the one who is betraying Me has drawn near.',
'26:47': '[a]And while He was still speaking, behold, [b]Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.',
'26:48': 'Now the one who was betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, Whomever I kiss, He is the one; seize Him.',
'26:49': 'And immediately he came to Jesus and said, [1]Rejoice, [a]Rabbi, and [b]kissed Him affectionately.',
'26:50': 'But Jesus said to him, [a]Friend, [1b]what are you here for? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.',
'26:51': 'And behold, [1]one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his [a]sword, and struck the slave of the high priest and took off his [b]ear.',
'26:52': 'Then Jesus said to him, Return your sword to its place, for all those who take up the [a]sword will perish by the sword.',
'26:53': 'Or do you think that I cannot [1]beseech My Father, and He will [1]provide Me at once with more than twelve [1]legions of [a]angels?',
'26:54': 'How then shall the [a]Scriptures be fulfilled <I>which</I> <I>say</I> that it must happen [1]this way?',
'26:55': 'In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs to arrest Me? Day after day I sat in the temple [a]teaching, and you did not seize Me.',
'26:56': 'But all this has happened in order that the writings of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left Him and [a]fled.',
'26:57': '[a]And those who seized Jesus led <I>Him</I> away to [b]Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.',
'26:58': 'And Peter [a]followed Him at a distance to the courtyard of the high priest; and entering within, he sat with the attendants to see the end.',
'26:59': 'Now the chief priests and the whole [a]Sanhedrin were seeking [b]false testimony against Jesus so that they might put Him to death,',
'26:60': 'And they did not find <I>it</I>, though many false witnesses came forward. But later [a]two came',
'26:61': 'And said, This man said, [1]I am able to [a]destroy the temple of God and build <I>it</I> up in three days.',
'26:62': 'And the high priest stood up and said to Him, Do You answer [1a]nothing? What <I>is</I> <I>it</I> <I>that</I> these testify [b]against You?',
'26:63': 'But Jesus remained [1a]silent. [b]And the high priest said to Him, I charge You to [c]swear by the living God to tell us [2d]if You are the [e]Christ, the Son of God.',
'26:64': 'Jesus said to him, [a]You have said <I>rightly</I>. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the [1b]Son of Man [c]sitting at the right hand of Power and [d]coming on the [e]clouds of heaven.',
'26:65': 'Then the high priest [a]tore his garments, saying, He has [b]blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.',
'26:66': 'What do you think? And they answered and said, He is worthy of [a]death.',
'26:67': 'Then they [a]spat in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others [b]slapped <I>Him</I>,',
'26:68': 'Saying, [1]Prophesy to us, Christ! [a]Who is the one who hit You?',
'26:69': '[a]Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a [1]servant girl came to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean.',
'26:70': 'But he denied <I>it</I> before all, saying, I do not know what you are talking about!',
'26:71': 'And after he had gone out to the porch, another girl saw him and said to those who were there, This man was with Jesus the [a]Nazarene.',
'26:72': 'And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man!',
'26:73': 'And after a little while [1]those who were standing <I>there</I> came to Peter and said, Surely you also are one of them, for your [a]speech also makes it clear <I>that</I> you <I>are</I>.',
'26:74': 'Then he began to [1]curse and to swear: I do not know the man! And immediately a rooster crowed.',
'26:75': 'And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before a [a]rooster crows, you will deny Me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.',
'27:1': '[a]Now when morning had come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took [b]counsel against Jesus to put Him to death.',
'27:2': 'And having bound Him, they led <I>Him</I> away and delivered <I>Him</I> to [1a]Pilate the governor.',
'27:3': 'Then [a]Judas, who betrayed Him, seeing that He was condemned, [1]regretted and returned the [b]thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,',
'27:4': 'Saying, I have sinned in betraying [a]innocent blood. But they said, What is that to us? You see <I>to</I> <I>that</I> yourself!',
'27:5': 'And he threw the pieces of silver into the temple and departed, and he went away and [a]hanged himself.',
'27:6': 'And the [1]chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to put them into the [2]temple [a]treasury, since it is blood money.',
'27:7': 'And after taking counsel, they bought with it the potter&rsquo;s field as a burial place for strangers.',
'27:8': 'Therefore that field has been called the [a]Field of Blood to this day.',
'27:9': 'At that time what was spoken through [1]Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, saying, [a]&ldquo;And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him that had been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel had priced,',
'27:10': 'And they gave them for the potter&rsquo;s field, as the Lord directed me.&rdquo;',
'27:11': '[a]And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned Him, saying, Are You the [b]King of the Jews? And Jesus said, [c]It is as you say.',
'27:12': 'And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered [1a]nothing.',
'27:13': 'Then Pilate said to Him, Do You not hear how many things they testify [a]against You?',
'27:14': 'And He did [1a]not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor marveled greatly.',
'27:15': '[a]Now at the feasts the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wanted.',
'27:16': 'And they had at that time a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.',
'27:17': 'Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, [1]Whom do you want me to release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?',
'27:18': 'For he knew that <I>it</I> <I>was</I> because of envy <I>that</I> they had delivered Him up.',
'27:19': 'And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent <I>word</I> to him, saying, Have nothing to do with that [a]righteous man, for I have suffered much today in a [1b]dream because of Him.',
'27:20': 'But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to [a]ask for Barabbas and to destroy Jesus.',
'27:21': 'And the governor answered and said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release to you? And they said, Barabbas.',
'27:22': 'Pilate said to them, What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said, Let Him be crucified!',
'27:23': 'But he said, Why, [a]what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let Him be crucified!',
'27:24': 'And Pilate, seeing that nothing was gained but rather that an [a]uproar was taking place, took water and [1b]washed his hands before the crowd, saying, [2]I am innocent of this [3c]man&rsquo;s blood. You see <I>to</I> <I>it</I> yourselves.',
'27:25': 'And all the people answered and said, His [a]blood be upon us and upon our children!',
'27:26': 'Then he released to them Barabbas, but Jesus he [1a]scourged and delivered up to be [2]crucified.',
'27:27': '[a]Then the governor&rsquo;s soldiers took Jesus into the [1b]praetorium and gathered about Him the whole cohort.',
'27:28': 'And they stripped Him and put a scarlet robe around Him,',
'27:29': 'And they wove a crown of [1a]thorns and placed <I>it</I> on His head and <I>put</I> a reed in His right hand; and they kneeled before Him and [b]mocked Him, saying, [2]Rejoice, King of the Jews!',
'27:30': 'And they [a]spat on Him and took the reed and beat Him on the head.',
'27:31': 'And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe and put His garments on Him, and [1]led Him away to crucify <I>Him</I>.',
'27:32': '[a]And as they were going out, they found a man of [1b]Cyrene, Simon by name; this one they compelled to take up His cross.',
'27:33': 'And when they had come to a place called [1]Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,',
'27:34': '[a]They gave Him [1]wine to drink, mingled with [b]gall. And when He tasted <I>it</I>, He would [2]not drink.',
'27:35': 'And when they had crucified Him, they [1a]divided His garments <I>among</I> <I>themselves</I>, casting lots.',
'27:36': 'And they sat down and [a]guarded Him there.',
'27:37': '[a]And they set in writing over His head the charge against Him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.',
'27:38': 'At that time [a]two [1]robbers were crucified with Him, one on the right and one on the left.',
'27:39': 'And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, [a]wagging their heads',
'27:40': 'And saying, You who [a]destroy the temple and build it up in three days, [b]save Yourself! [1c]If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross!',
'27:41': '[a]Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes and elders mocked <I>Him</I> and said,',
'27:42': 'He saved others; Himself He [1]cannot save. He is [a]King of Israel; let Him come down now from the cross, and we will believe on Him.',
'27:43': 'He trusts in God; let Him [a]rescue <I>Him</I> now if He wants Him, for He said, I am the Son of God.',
'27:44': 'And in the same way the robbers who were crucified with Him also [a]reproached Him.',
'27:45': '[a]Now from the [1]sixth hour darkness fell over all the land until the [1]ninth hour.',
'27:46': 'And about the [1]ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, [a]My God, My God, [2]why have You forsaken Me?',
'27:47': 'And some of those standing there, when they heard <I>this</I>, said, This man is calling Elijah.',
'27:48': 'And immediately one of them ran, and taking a sponge, he soaked it with [1a]vinegar and put it on a reed, and gave <I>it</I> to Him to drink.',
'27:49': 'But the rest said, Let <I>Him</I> <I>be</I>. Let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him.',
'27:50': 'And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and [1a]yielded up His spirit.',
'27:51': 'And behold, the [1a]veil of the temple was split in two [2]from top to bottom, and the [3]earth was shaken and the [4]rocks were split,',
'27:52': 'And the [1]tombs were opened, and many [2]bodies of the saints who had fallen [a]asleep were raised.',
'27:53': 'And they [1]came out of the tombs after His resurrection and entered into the holy city and [2]appeared to many.',
'27:54': 'Now the centurion and those with him [a]guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that happened, became greatly frightened, saying, Truly this was the [b]Son of God.',
'27:55': 'And many women were there looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, [a]ministering to Him,',
'27:56': 'Among whom were [a]Mary the Magdalene, and [1]Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the [b]mother of the sons of Zebedee.',
'27:57': '[a]And when [1]evening fell, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.',
'27:58': 'This man came to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that it be given <I>to</I> <I>him</I>.',
'27:59': 'And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean, fine linen cloth.',
'27:60': 'And he [1]laid it in his <I>own</I> [a]new tomb, which he had [b]hewn in the rock. And having rolled a [c]great stone in front of the door of the tomb, he went away.',
'27:61': 'And [a]Mary the Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.',
'27:62': 'On the next day, which is <I>the</I> <I>day</I> after the [1]preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered unto Pilate,',
'27:63': 'Saying, Sir, we have remembered that while He was still living, that [a]deceiver said, [b]After three days I will arise.',
'27:64': 'Therefore, give orders for the grave to be secured until the third day, lest His disciples come and [a]steal Him away and say to the people, He has been raised from the dead. And the last deception will be worse than the first.',
'27:65': 'Pilate said to them, Take a [a]guard. Go and make <I>the</I> <I>tomb</I> as secure as you know how.',
'27:66': 'And they went and secured the grave, [1a]sealing the stone, with the guard <I>being</I> <I>there</I>.',
'28:1': '[a]Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to [1]dawn toward the [2b]first day of the week, [c]Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.',
'28:2': 'And behold, there was a great [1]earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.',
'28:3': 'And his appearance was like [a]lightning, and his garment as [b]white as snow.',
'28:4': 'And for fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men.',
'28:5': 'And the angel answered and said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you are seeking Jesus, the crucified.',
'28:6': '[1]He is not here, for He has been [a]raised, even as He said. Come, see the place where He was lying.',
'28:7': 'And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has been raised from the dead, and behold, He goes before you into [1a]Galilee. There you will see Him. Behold, I have told you.',
'28:8': 'And they went away quickly from the tomb with [1]fear and great joy and ran to report <I>this</I> to His disciples.',
'28:9': 'And behold, Jesus [1]met them, saying, [2]Rejoice! And they came to <I>Him</I> and took hold of His feet and [a]worshipped Him.',
'28:10': 'Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid. Go and report to My [1a]brothers that they should go into [2b]Galilee, and there they will see Me.',
'28:11': 'And as they were going, behold, some from the [a]guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.',
'28:12': 'And after <I>the</I> <I>chief</I> <I>priests</I> had gathered with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,',
'28:13': 'Saying, Say <I>this</I>, [1]His disciples came by night and [a]stole Him away while we slept.',
'28:14': 'And if this comes to the [a]governor&rsquo;s ears, we will [1]persuade him and make sure that you have nothing to worry about.',
'28:15': 'And they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been widely [1]spread among the Jews until this very day.',
'28:16': 'And the eleven disciples went to [a]Galilee, to the [1]mountain where Jesus directed them.',
'28:17': 'And when they saw Him, they [a]worshipped <I>Him</I>, though some [1]doubted.',
'28:18': 'And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All [1]authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.',
'28:19': 'Go [1]therefore and [2]disciple all the [a]nations, [3]baptizing them [4]into the [5]name of the [6]Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,',
'28:20': '[1]Teaching them to [a]observe all that I have [b]commanded you. And behold, I am [2c]with you all the days until the [3d]consummation of the age.',

The Old Testament gives a portrait, in types and prophecies, of this wonderful person as the Coming One. Now, in the New Testament, this wonderful person has come. The first page of the New Testament, in recommending this wonderful person to us, gives us His genealogy. This genealogy can be considered an abstract of the Old Testament, which in itself is the detailed genealogy of Christ. To understand the genealogy in Matthew, we need to trace the origin and history of every incident.","Christ, as the wonderful center of the entire Bible, is all-inclusive, having many aspects. The New Testament at its beginning presents four biographies to portray the four main aspects of this all-inclusive Christ. The Gospel of Matthew testifies that He is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, who brings the kingdom of the heavens to the earth. The Gospel of Mark tells us that He is the Servant of God, laboring for God faithfully. Mark&rsquo;s account is most simple, for a servant does not warrant a detailed record. The Gospel of Luke presents a full picture of Him as the only proper and normal man who ever lived on this earth; as such a man, He is the Savior of mankind. The Gospel of John unveils Him as the Son of God, the very God Himself, who is life to God&rsquo;s people. Among the four Gospels, Matthew and Luke have a record of genealogy; Mark and John do not. To testify that Jesus is the King, the Christ of God prophesied in the Old Testament, Matthew needs to show us the antecedents and status of this King, to prove that He is the proper successor to the throne of David. To prove that Jesus is a proper and normal man, Luke needs to show the generations of this man, to attest that He is qualified to be the Savior of mankind. For the record of a servant, Mark does not need to tell us His origin. To unveil that Jesus is the very God, neither does John need to give us His human genealogy; rather, he declares that, as the Word of God, He is the very God in the beginning.","The kingdom, of which Christ is the King, is composed of Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, including both his descendants in the flesh and those in faith. Hence, the genealogy of Christ in Matthew begins with Abraham, the father of the called race, not with Adam, the father of the created race. God&rsquo;s kingdom is not built with the created race of Adam but with the called race of Abraham, which includes both the real Israelites ({Rom9:6|Rom. 9:6}-{Rom9:8|8}) and the believers in Christ ({Gal3:7|Gal. 3:7}, {Gal3:9|9}, {Gal3:29|29}). To prove by relating His genealogy that Jesus is a proper man qualified to be the Savior of mankind, Luke traces His genealogy back to Adam, the first generation of mankind."]},

Both the reality and the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens are with the church today. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the proper church life ({Rom14:17|Rom. 14:17}), which exists in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, known as Christendom.

John the Baptist&rsquo;s recommending ministry began with a preliminary baptism, a baptism by water only. Now, after the heavenly King had accomplished His ministry on earth, had passed through the process of death and resurrection, and had become the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit ({Act2:38|Acts 2:38}, {Act2:41|41}; {Act10:44|10:44}-{Act10:48|48}). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect, whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible baptism by the Spirit, the visible baptism by water is vain, and without the visible baptism by water, the invisible baptism by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed. Not long after the Lord charged the disciples with this baptism, He baptized them and the entire church in the Holy Spirit ({1Co12:13|1&nbsp;Cor. 12:13}), the Jewish part on the day of Pentecost ({Act1:5|Acts 1:5}; {Act2:4|2:4}) and the Gentile part in the house of Cornelius ({Act11:15|Acts 11:15}-{Act11:17|17}). Then, based on this, the disciples baptized the new converts ({Act2:38|Acts 2:38}) not only into water but also into the death of Christ ({Rom6:3|Rom. 6:3}-{Rom6:4|4}), into Christ Himself ({Gal3:27|Gal. 3:27}), into the Triune God ({Mat28:19|v. 19}), and into the Body of Christ ({1Co12:13|1&nbsp;Cor. 12:13}). The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb in which the baptized ones&rsquo; old history is ended. Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, and since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God ({Col2:9|Col. 2:9}) and the Triune God eventually is one with the Body of Christ, to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to do just one thing: on the negative side, to terminate their old life, and on the positive side, to germinate them with new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ. Hence, the baptism ordained by the Lord here baptizes people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens."]},

For our experience of life, John unveils the mystery of the Godhead in the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, especially in chs. {Mat14|14}&mdash;{Mat16|16}; whereas for the constituting of the kingdom, Matthew discloses the reality of the Divine Trinity by giving one name for all three. In the opening chapter of Matthew, the Holy Spirit ({Mat1:18|1:18}), Christ (the Son {Mat1:18|1:18}), and God (the Father&mdash;{Mat1:23|1:23}) are present for the producing of the man Jesus ({Mat1:21|1:21}), who, as Jehovah the Savior and God with us, is the very embodiment of the Triune God. In {Mat3|ch. 3} Matthew presents a scene in which the Son was standing in the water of baptism under the opened heaven, the Spirit like a dove descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke out of the heavens to the Son ({Mat3:16|3:16}-{Mat3:17|17}). In {Mat12|ch. 12} the Son, in the person of man, cast out demons by the Spirit to bring in the kingdom of God the Father ({Mat12:28|12:28}). In {Mat16|ch. 16} the Father revealed the Son to the disciples for the building of the church, which is the life pulse of the kingdom ({Mat16:16|16:16}-{Mat16:19|19}). In {Mat17|ch. 17} the Son entered into transfiguration ({Mat17:2|17:2}) and was confirmed by the Father&rsquo;s word of delight ({Mat17:5|17:5}), bringing about a miniature display of the manifestation of the kingdom ({Mat16:28|16:28}). Eventually, in the closing chapter, after Christ as the last Adam had passed through the process of crucifixion, entered into the realm of resurrection, and become the life-giving Spirit, He came back to His disciples in the atmosphere and reality of His resurrection to charge them to make the heathen the kingdom people by baptizing them into the name, the person, the reality, of the Divine Trinity. Later, in the Acts and the Epistles it is disclosed that to baptize people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is to baptize them into the name of Christ ({Act8:16|Acts 8:16}; {Act19:5|19:5}), and that to baptize them into the name of Christ is to baptize them into Christ the person ({Gal3:27|Gal. 3:27}; {Rom6:3|Rom. 6:3}), because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and He, having become the life-giving Spirit ({1Co15:45|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:45}), is available at any time and in any place for people to be baptized into. According to Matthew, being baptized into the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is for the constituting of the kingdom of the heavens. Unlike an earthly society, the heavenly kingdom cannot be formed with human beings of flesh and blood ({1Co15:50|1&nbsp;Cor. 15:50}); it can be constituted only with people who have been immersed into the union with the Triune God and who have been established and built up with the Triune God, who has been wrought into them."]},
