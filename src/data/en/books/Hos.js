verses: {
'1:1': '[1]The word of Jehovah which came to [2]Hosea the son of Beeri in the days of [a]Uzziah, [b]Jotham, [c]Ahaz, and [d]Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of [e]Jeroboam the son of Joash the king of Israel.',
'1:2': 'At the beginning of Jehovah&rsquo;s speaking to Hosea, Jehovah said to Hosea,<br>Go, take to yourself a [1]wife of [2]harlotries<br>And children of harlotries,<br>For the land is entirely given over to [a]harlotry,<br>And thus departs from Jehovah.',
'1:3': 'So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim. And she conceived and bore him a son.',
'1:4': 'And Jehovah said to him,<br>Call his name [1]Jezreel,<br>For yet a little while<br>And I will [2]avenge the [a]bloodshed of Jezreel<br>Upon the house of Jehu<br>And will bring an [b]end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.',
'1:5': 'And in that day<br>I will break the [a]bow of Israel<br>In the valley of Jezreel.',
'1:6': 'And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And He said to him,<br>Call her name [1]Lo-ruhamah,<br>For I will no longer have compassion<br>On the [a]house of Israel,<br>That I should forgive them at all.',
'1:7': 'But on the [a]house of Judah I will have compassion and will save them by Jehovah their God, and I will not save them by bow or by sword or by battle, by horses or by horsemen.',
'1:8': 'When she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.',
'1:9': 'And He said,<br>Call his name [1]Lo-ammi,<br>For you are [a]not My people,<br>And I will not belong to you.',
'1:10': 'But the [1]number of the children of Israel will be like the [2a]sand of the sea,<br>Which cannot be measured or numbered;<br>[b]And in the place where it will be said to them, You are not My people,<br>It will be said to them, You are the [3c]sons of the living God.',
'1:11': 'And the children of Judah and the children of Israel will be [a]gathered together,<br>And they will appoint for themselves one head, and they will go up from the land,<br>For great will be the day of [1]Jezreel.',
'2:1': 'Say to your brothers, [1]Ammi,<br>And to your sisters, [2]Ruhamah.',
'2:2': 'Contend with your [a]mother; contend.<br>For she is [1]not my wife,<br>And I am [1]not her husband.<br>And let her turn away her [b]harlotries from her face,<br>And her adulteries from between her breasts,',
'2:3': 'Lest I strip her naked<br>And set her out as in the day she was [a]born<br>And make her a wilderness<br>And make her a dry land<br>And slay her with thirst.',
'2:4': 'And on her children I will not have compassion,<br>For they are the children of harlotries.',
'2:5': 'For their mother has gone about as a [a]harlot;<br>She who conceived them has acted shamefully;<br>For she has said,<br>I will go after my [1]lovers,<br>Who give me my bread and my water,<br>My wool and my flax,<br>My oil and my drink.',
'2:6': 'Therefore I will now hedge up<br>[1]Her way with thorns;<br>And I will build up a wall against her,<br>So that she will not find her paths.',
'2:7': 'And she will pursue her lovers<br>But will not overtake them;<br>And she will seek them but not find them;<br>And she will say, [1]I will go<br>And [a]return to my first [b]husband,<br>For it was better for me then than now.',
'2:8': 'For she [a]did not know<br>That it was I who gave her<br>The grain and the new wine and the fresh oil,<br>And who multiplied to her silver<br>And gold, which they [1]used for Baal.',
'2:9': 'Therefore I will take back<br>My grain in its time<br>And My new wine in its appointed season,<br>And I will snatch away My wool and My flax,<br>Which were to cover her nakedness.',
'2:10': 'And now I will uncover her lewdness<br>In the sight of her lovers,<br>And no one will deliver her from My hand.',
'2:11': 'And I will bring all her mirth to an end,<br>Her [a]feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths,<br>And all her appointed assemblies.',
'2:12': 'And I will desolate her vine and her fig tree,<br>Of which she said,<br>These are my payments<br>That my lovers have given me;<br>And I will make them a forest,<br>And the beasts of the field will devour them.',
'2:13': 'And I will visit the days of the Baals upon her,<br>In which she burned incense to them<br>And adorned herself with her nose rings and her jewels<br>And went after her lovers<br>And forgot Me,<br>Declares Jehovah.',
'2:14': 'Therefore I am now luring her,<br>And I will bring her into the [a]wilderness<br>And will [b]speak to her heart.',
'2:15': 'And I will give her her vineyards from there<br>And the valley of [a]Achor as a door of hope;<br>And she will respond there as in the days of her [b]youth<br>And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.',
'2:16': 'And in that day, declares Jehovah,<br>You will call Me My [a]Husband<br>And will no longer call Me [1]Baali.',
'2:17': 'For I will take away the names of the Baals from her mouth,<br>And they will no longer be remembered by their name.',
'2:18': 'And I will make a [1a]covenant for them<br>In that day<br>With the beasts of the field<br>And with the birds of heaven<br>And the creeping things of the earth;<br>And bow and sword and battle<br>I will [b]break from the land,<br>And I will cause them to lie down in [c]safety.',
'2:19': 'And I will [a]betroth you to Myself forever;<br>Indeed I will betroth you to Myself<br>In righteousness and justice<br>And in lovingkindness and compassions;',
'2:20': 'Indeed I will betroth you to Myself in faithfulness,<br>And you will know Jehovah.',
'2:21': 'And in that day<br>I will answer, declares Jehovah;<br>I will answer the heavens,<br>And they will answer the earth,',
'2:22': 'And the earth will answer the [1]grain<br>And the [1]new wine and the [1]fresh oil,<br>And they will answer Jezreel.',
'2:23': 'And I will sow her for Myself in the land;<br>And I will have compassion on [1]Lo-ruhamah,<br>And I will say to [2]Lo-ammi, [a]You are My people;<br>And they will say, My God.',
'3:1': 'Then Jehovah said to me, Go [1]again, love a woman who is loved by her companion yet who is an adulteress, even as Jehovah has [a]loved the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes.',
'3:2': 'So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer of barley and a half-homer of barley.',
'3:3': 'And I said to her, You will abide for me for [1]many days; you shall not go about as a harlot nor be another man&rsquo;s; and I will be the same toward you.',
'3:4': 'For the children of Israel will [a]abide for many days without king and without prince and without sacrifice and without pillar and without ephod and teraphim.',
'3:5': 'Afterward the children of Israel will return and [a]seek Jehovah their God and [1b]David their King, and they will come with fear to Jehovah and to His goodness in the [2c]last days.',
'4:1': 'Hear the word of Jehovah,<br>O children of Israel;<br>For Jehovah has a [a]controversy<br>With the inhabitants of the land.<br>For there is no [1]faithfulness or kindness<br>And [b]no knowledge of God in the land.',
'4:2': 'Rather there are swearing and deceiving and murder<br>And stealing and adultery;<br>They are violent,<br>And bloodshed follows bloodshed.',
'4:3': 'Because of this the land mourns,<br>And all the inhabitants languish within it,<br>With the beasts of the field<br>And with the birds of heaven;<br>Indeed, even the fish of the sea will be taken away.',
'4:4': 'Yet let no man contend,<br>And let no man reprove;<br>For your people are like those who contend with the priest.',
'4:5': 'And [1]you will stumble in the day,<br>And the prophet also will stumble<br>With you in the night;<br>And I will destroy your mother.',
'4:6': 'My people are destroyed<br>Because of a [a]lack of [1]that knowledge.<br>For you have rejected [1]that knowledge,<br>And I will reject you, so that you will not be a priest to Me;<br>Since you have forgotten the law of your God,<br>I also will forget your children.',
'4:7': 'The more [1]they were multiplied, the more they sinned against Me;<br>I will change their glory into [a]shame.',
'4:8': 'They feed on the sin of My people,<br>And [1]their soul desires their iniquity.',
'4:9': 'And it will be that as it is with the people, [1]so it will be with the priest;<br>Thus I will visit their ways upon them,<br>And I will recompense their doings to them.',
'4:10': 'And they will eat but will [a]not be filled;<br>And they will commit fornication but will not increase;<br>For they have ceased giving heed to Jehovah.',
'4:11': 'Fornication and wine<br>And new wine [1]take away their heart.',
'4:12': 'My people inquire at their [1]wooden post,<br>And their rod informs them of things;<br>For a spirit of harlotries makes them err,<br>And they have gone about as [a]harlots away from their God.',
'4:13': 'Upon the tops of the mountains they offer sacrifices,<br>And upon the hills they burn incense,<br>Under oak, poplar, and terebinth,<br>Because its shade is good.<br>Therefore your daughters go about as harlots,<br>And your brides commit adultery.',
'4:14': 'I will not [1]punish your daughters when they go about as harlots<br>Nor your brides when they commit adultery;<br>For the men themselves go off with harlots,<br>And they offer sacrifices with the [2]prostitutes;<br>And the people who have no understanding will be cast down.',
'4:15': 'Though you, Israel, go about as a harlot,<br>Let not Judah trespass;<br>And do not come to [1a]Gilgal,<br>Nor go up to [2b]Beth-aven,<br>Nor swear, As Jehovah lives.',
'4:16': 'For Israel is [a]stubborn,<br>Like a stubborn heifer;<br>Will Jehovah now pasture them<br>Like a lamb in a spacious place?',
'4:17': 'Ephraim is joined to idols;<br>Leave him alone.',
'4:18': 'Their liquor has ended;<br>They have given themselves up to harlotry;<br>Their [1]rulers dearly love shame.',
'4:19': 'The wind has wrapped her up in its wings,<br>And they will be ashamed because of their sacrifices.',
'5:1': 'Hear this, O priests;<br>And listen, O house of Israel;<br>And, O house of the king, give ear.<br>For to you belongs the judgment,<br>For you have been a snare at Mizpah<br>And a net spread over Tabor.',
'5:2': 'And the revolters have gone deep [1]into slaughtering,<br>Though I am a chastisement to them all.',
'5:3': 'I know Ephraim,<br>And Israel is not hidden from Me;<br>For now, Ephraim, you have gone about as a [a]harlot;<br>Israel is defiled.',
'5:4': 'Their doings do not permit them<br>To turn to their God;<br>For a spirit of harlotries is within them,<br>And they do not know Jehovah.',
'5:5': 'And the pride of Israel testifies to his face,<br>And Ephraim and Israel will stumble in their iniquity;<br>Judah also will stumble with them.',
'5:6': 'With their flocks and with their herds they will go<br>To [a]seek Jehovah,<br>But they will not find Him;<br>He has withdrawn Himself from them.',
'5:7': 'They have acted treacherously against Jehovah,<br>For they have begotten strange children.<br>Now the new moon will devour them<br>With their apportionments.',
'5:8': 'Blow the horn in Gibeah,<br>The trumpet in Ramah;<br>Sound an alarm at [a]Beth-aven:<br>Behind you, O Benjamin!',
'5:9': 'Ephraim will be a desolation<br>In the day of correction;<br>Among the tribes of Israel<br>I have made known what is sure.',
'5:10': 'The princes of Judah have become<br>Like those who move a [a]boundary mark.<br>I will pour out upon them<br>My overflowing wrath like water.',
'5:11': 'Ephraim is oppressed,<br>Crushed by judgment,<br>For he was determined to walk<br>After man&rsquo;s command.',
'5:12': 'Therefore I am like a moth to Ephraim<br>And like rottenness to the house of Judah.',
'5:13': 'When Ephraim saw his sickness,<br>And Judah his [a]wound,<br>Ephraim went to [b]Assyria<br>And sent word to the warrior king;<br>But he cannot heal you,<br>And the wound will not depart from you.',
'5:14': 'For I will be like a lion to Ephraim<br>And like a young lion to the house of Judah.<br>I, I will tear them and go away;<br>I will carry them off, and there will be no one to deliver them.',
'5:15': 'I will go away, I will return to My place,<br>[a]Until they acknowledge their offense<br>And seek My face;<br>In their affliction they will seek Me [1]earnestly.',
'6:1': 'Come and let us [a]return to Jehovah;<br>For He has torn us, but He will [b]heal us,<br>And He has stricken us, but He will bind us up.',
'6:2': 'He will enliven us after [1]two days;<br>On the [1a]third day He will raise us up,<br>And we will live in His presence.',
'6:3': 'Therefore let us know, let us pursue knowing Jehovah:<br>[1]His going forth is as sure as the [a]dawn,<br>And He will come to us as the rain,<br>As the late rain which [b]waters the earth.',
'6:4': 'What shall I do with you, O [1]Ephraim?<br>What shall I do with you, O Judah?<br>For your lovingkindness is like a morning cloud<br>And like dew that departs early.',
'6:5': 'Therefore I hewed them to pieces by the prophets;<br>I slew them by the [a]words of My mouth,<br>And [1]My judgments went forth as light.',
'6:6': '[a]For I delight in lovingkindness and not [b]sacrifice,<br>And the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.',
'6:7': 'But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant;<br>There they have acted treacherously against Me.',
'6:8': 'Gilead is a city of those who commit iniquity;<br>It is tracked with blood.',
'6:9': 'And like bands of robbers lying in wait for a man,<br>The company of priests murder on the way to Shechem;<br>Indeed they commit wickedness.',
'6:10': 'In the house of Israel I have seen a horrid thing:<br>The harlotry of Ephraim is there;<br>Israel has defiled itself.',
'6:11': 'Also, O Judah, there is a [1]harvest appointed for you,<br>When I will [a]turn the captivity of My people.',
'7:1': 'When I would [a]heal Israel,<br>Then the [1]iniquity of Ephraim is discovered<br>As well as the evil deeds of Samaria;<br>For they practice falsehood.<br>And the thief comes inside;<br>The band of robbers makes raids outside.',
'7:2': 'And they do not say in their hearts<br>That I [a]remember all their evil.<br>Now their doings are all around them;<br>They are before My [b]face.',
'7:3': 'They make the king glad with their evil,<br>And the princes, with their lies.',
'7:4': 'All of them practice adultery;<br>They are like an oven heated by the baker:<br>He ceases from stirring the fire,<br>After kneading the dough, until it is [a]leavened.',
'7:5': 'On the feast day of our king<br>The princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine;<br>He stretched out his hand with scorners.',
'7:6': 'For they have made their heart ready<br>Like an oven while they lie in wait:<br>All night long<br>Their baker sleeps,<br>But in the morning [1]the oven burns<br>Like a flaming fire.',
'7:7': 'All of them are hot like an oven,<br>And they devour their [1]judges;<br>All their kings fall;<br>There is no one among them who [a]calls on Me.',
'7:8': 'Ephraim&mdash;among the peoples<br>He mixes himself;<br>Ephraim is a cake<br>[1]Not turned.',
'7:9': 'Strangers have devoured his strength,<br>And he himself does not know it;<br>Indeed gray hairs are all over him,<br>And he himself does not know it.',
'7:10': 'And the pride of Israel testifies to his face;<br>Yet they have not returned to Jehovah their God,<br>And they have not sought Him, because of all this.',
'7:11': 'And Ephraim has become like a silly dove<br>Without [1]understanding:<br>They call to [a]Egypt;<br>They go to Assyria.',
'7:12': 'When they go,<br>I will spread My net over them;<br>I will bring them down like the birds of heaven;<br>I will chasten them according to the report given to their assembly.',
'7:13': 'Woe to them! For they have wandered from Me.<br>Devastation to them! For they have transgressed against Me.<br>And I would have redeemed them,<br>But they have spoken lies against Me.',
'7:14': 'And they did not cry unto Me in their heart<br>When they howled in their beds.<br>For grain and new wine they assemble themselves;<br>They rebel against Me.',
'7:15': 'Though I trained them and strengthened their arms,<br>They devise evil against Me.',
'7:16': 'They return, but not to Him who is on high;<br>They are like a [1]deceitful bow.<br>Their princes will fall by the sword<br>Because of the rage of their tongue.<br>This will be their derision<br>In the land of [a]Egypt.',
'8:1': 'A trumpet to your lips!<br>Like an [a]eagle he comes against the house of Jehovah,<br>Because they have trespassed My [1b]covenant<br>And have transgressed against My [1]law.',
'8:2': 'They will cry unto Me,<br>My God, we&mdash;Israel&mdash;know You.',
'8:3': 'Israel has cast off what is good;<br>The enemy will pursue him.',
'8:4': 'They have set up [a]kings, but not by Me;<br>They have set up princes, but I did not acknowledge it.<br>With their silver and their gold they made<br>Idols for themselves,<br>That they might be cut off.',
'8:5': 'Your [1a]calf has cast you off, O [1]Samaria;<br>My anger burns against them.<br>How long will they be incapable of [2]innocence?',
'8:6': 'For from Israel is this!<br>A workman made it;<br>Thus it is no God.<br>The calf of Samaria<br>Will be shattered to pieces.',
'8:7': 'For they have [a]sown wind,<br>And they will reap a whirlwind.<br>It has no stalk; should there be a sprout,<br>It will not produce flour;<br>If it should produce,<br>Strangers will swallow it up.',
'8:8': 'Israel has been swallowed up;<br>Now they have become among the nations<br>Like a vessel in which no one takes pleasure.',
'8:9': 'For they have gone up to [a]Assyria<br>Like a wild ass gone alone by itself;<br>Ephraim has [b]hired lovers.',
'8:10': 'Indeed though they have hired such among the nations,<br>I will now [a]gather them;<br>And they will begin to be diminished because of the burden<br>Of the [b]king of the princes.',
'8:11': 'Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin,<br>Altars will be to him for sin.',
'8:12': 'I wrote for him the ten thousand things of My law,<br>But they are considered as a strange thing.',
'8:13': 'As for the sacrifices of My offerings,<br>They sacrifice flesh and eat it,<br>But Jehovah has [a]no delight in them.<br>Now He will [b]remember their iniquity,<br>And He will punish their sins;<br>They will return to [c]Egypt.',
'8:14': 'For Israel has forgotten his [a]Maker<br>And has built palaces,<br>And Judah has multiplied fortified cities;<br>But I will send [1]fire into his cities,<br>And it will devour its citadels.',
'9:1': 'Do not rejoice, O Israel,<br>To exult like the nations.<br>For you have gone as a [a]harlot away from your God;<br>You have loved payment<br>Upon every grain floor.',
'9:2': 'The threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them,<br>And the new wine will fail her.',
'9:3': 'They will not dwell in the land of Jehovah;<br>But Ephraim will return to [a]Egypt,<br>And in Assyria they will eat [b]what is unclean.',
'9:4': 'They will not pour out offerings of wine to Jehovah,<br>Neither will their sacrifices be pleasing to Him;<br>They will be to them as the bread of mourning;<br>All who eat them will be unclean,<br>For their bread will be for themselves;<br>It will not come into the house of Jehovah.',
'9:5': 'What will you do<br>In the day of assembly<br>And in the day of the feast of Jehovah?',
'9:6': 'For they will go because of destruction;<br>Egypt will gather them;<br>[1]Moph will bury them.<br>As for their desirable [2]things of silver, nettles will dispossess them;<br>Thistles will be in their tents.',
'9:7': 'The days of the visitation have come;<br>The days of the recompense have come;<br>Israel will know it.<br>The prophet is a fool,<br>The [1]inspired man is mad,<br>Because of the greatness of your iniquity<br>And because of the greatness of the enmity.',
'9:8': 'Ephraim was a [1]watchman<br>With my God.<br>As for the [2]prophet, a fowler&rsquo;s trap<br>Is in all his ways;<br>Enmity is in the house of his God.',
'9:9': 'They have deeply corrupted themselves<br>As in the days of [1a]Gibeah;<br>He will remember their iniquity;<br>He will punish their sins.',
'9:10': 'I [1]found Israel<br>Like grapes in the wilderness;<br>I saw your fathers<br>As the first ripe fruit on the fig tree at its beginning.<br>They went to [a]Baal-peor<br>And sanctified themselves unto the shameful thing,<br>And they became detestable, like the thing that they loved.',
'9:11': 'As for Ephraim, their glory<br>Will fly away like a bird&mdash;<br>No birth, no pregnancy, and no conception!',
'9:12': 'For even if they bring up their children,<br>I will bereave them, so that not a man is left.<br>Indeed woe also to them<br>When I [a]turn away from them.',
'9:13': 'Ephraim, as I have seen him,<br>Is planted like Tyre in a meadow;<br>But Ephraim will bring forth<br>His children to the slayer.',
'9:14': 'Give them, O Jehovah&mdash;<br>What will You give them?<br>Give them a miscarrying womb<br>And dry breasts.',
'9:15': 'All their evil is in [a]Gilgal,<br>For there I hated them.<br>Because of the evil of their doings<br>I will drive them from My house,<br>I will love them no more;<br>All their princes are rebels.',
'9:16': 'Ephraim is stricken;<br>Their root is dried up;<br>They will not bear fruit.<br>Indeed though they bring forth,<br>I will kill the beloved fruit of their womb.',
'9:17': 'My God has rejected them,<br>For they did not listen to Him.<br>And they will be [a]wanderers among the nations.',
'10:1': 'Israel is a luxuriant [a]vine;<br>He brings forth fruit for [1]himself.<br>According to the abundance of his fruit<br>He has multiplied altars;<br>According to the goodness of their land<br>They have made pillars well.',
'10:2': 'Their heart is [a]divided;<br>Now they will be found guilty.<br>He Himself will break down their altars;<br>He will destroy their pillars.',
'10:3': 'For now they will say,<br>We have [1a]no king,<br>For we did not fear Jehovah;<br>And the king, what can he do for us?',
'10:4': 'They speak mere words,<br>Swearing falsely<br>While making a covenant;<br>And judgment sprouts forth like poisonous weeds<br>In the furrows of the field.',
'10:5': 'The inhabitants of Samaria will fear<br>For the [a]calves of [1]Beth-aven;<br>For its people will mourn over it,<br>And its idol priests [2]will tremble for it,<br>For its glory,<br>Because it has departed from it.',
'10:6': 'Indeed it will be carried to [a]Assyria:<br>A present to the warrior king.<br>Ephraim will be taken in shame,<br>And Israel will be ashamed of his own counsel.',
'10:7': '[a]Samaria will be cut off with her king<br>And will be like twigs on the surface of the water.',
'10:8': 'And the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel,<br>Will be destroyed.<br>The thorn and the thistle will come up<br>Upon their altars;<br>And they will say to the [a]mountains, Cover us!<br>And to the hills, Fall on us!',
'10:9': 'Since the days of [a]Gibeah<br>You have sinned, O Israel;<br>There they have stood.<br>Did not the [b]battle<br>Overtake them in Gibeah<br>Because of the children of iniquity?',
'10:10': 'When I so desire, I will chastise them;<br>And the peoples will be [a]gathered against them,<br>When they are bound for their [1]double iniquity.',
'10:11': 'And Ephraim is a trained heifer<br>That loves to tread the grain;<br>But I have passed the yoke<br>Over her fair neck:<br>I will make Ephraim draw the plow;<br>Judah will plow;<br>Jacob will break his clods.',
'10:12': '[1a]Sow unto righteousness for yourselves;<br>Reap according to lovingkindness;<br>Break up your [2]fallow ground;<br>For it is time to seek Jehovah<br>Until He comes and rains<br>Righteousness on you.',
'10:13': 'You have plowed wickedness;<br>You have reaped injustice;<br>You have eaten the fruit of lying.<br>For you have trusted in your way,<br>In the multitude of your mighty men.',
'10:14': 'And a [1]tumult will arise among your peoples;<br>And all your fortresses will be devastated,<br>As [a]Shalman devastated Beth-arbel<br>In the day of battle:<br>The mother was dashed in pieces with the children.',
'10:15': 'Thus Bethel will cause this to happen to you<br>Because of your great evil:<br>At [1]dawn the king of Israel<br>Will be utterly cut off.',
'11:1': 'When Israel was a [a]child, I [1]loved him,<br>And [b]out of Egypt I called My [2c]son.',
'11:2': 'As [1]they called them,<br>So they went from them;<br>To the [a]Baals they sacrificed,<br>And to the idols they burned incense.',
'11:3': 'And it was I who taught Ephraim to walk<br>(He [a]took them in His arms),<br>But they did not know that I [b]healed them.',
'11:4': 'I drew them [1]with cords of a man,<br>With bands of love;<br>And I was to them like those<br>Who lift off the [2]yoke on their jaws;<br>And I gently caused them to [2]eat.',
'11:5': 'They will not return to the land of Egypt,<br>But the Assyrian will be their king,<br>For they refused to return to Me.',
'11:6': 'And the sword will whirl about in their cities<br>And will consume their bars,<br>And it will devour them because of their own counsels.',
'11:7': 'Indeed My people are bent upon turning away from Me;<br>Though they call them to Him who is on high,<br>None at all exalts Him.',
'11:8': 'How shall I give you up, O Ephraim?<br>How shall I deliver you up, O Israel?<br>How can I make you like [1a]Admah?<br>How can I treat you like [1]Zeboim?<br>My heart is turned within Me;<br>All My [b]compassions have warmed.',

These twelve books complete the divine revelation concerning God&rsquo;s economy in His dealings with His elect (Israel) and the nations, which is covered in detail in the books of the Major Prophets&mdash;Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. All the books of both the Major Prophets and the Minor Prophets were called by the Lord Jesus &ldquo;the Prophets,&rdquo; in which things were written concerning Him ({Luk24:44|Luke 24:44}). Thus, the central point of all the Prophets is Christ (cf. {Luk24:27|Luke 24:27}; {Joh5:39|John 5:39}).","Like the Major Prophets, the Minor Prophets unveil that God&rsquo;s economy in His loving chastisement of Israel, in His governmental dealing with Israel, and in His judgment upon the nations issues in the manifestation of Christ as the centrality and universality in God&rsquo;s economy to bring in the kingdom, the age of restoration ({Mat19:28|Matt. 19:28}; {Act3:21|Acts 3:21}), which will usher the old and ruined universe into the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem ({Rev21:1|Rev. 21:1}-{Rev21:2|2})."]},

But when God&rsquo;s everlasting and unchanging love is touched, Israel is called God&rsquo;s son ({Exo4:22|Exo. 4:22}-{Exo4:23|23}), indicating that in God&rsquo;s view Israel has the Father&rsquo;s life (cf. {Hos1:10|1:10} and {Hos1:10^3|note 3}). God&rsquo;s everlasting love is not a love in affection, like the love of a husband toward a wife, but a love in life, like the love of a father toward a son. On the one hand, God loves us as His wife, and the Lord Jesus is our Husband ({Joh3:29|John 3:29}; {2Co11:2|2&nbsp;Cor. 11:2}).

This indicates that although Israel became exceedingly evil, Christ still became organically one with Israel through incarnation to be a real Israelite. Christ joined Himself to Israel in the matter of being a son of God.","This verse implies Christ as the Son of God. It also implies that all God&rsquo;s chosen people become sons of God by virtue of their being organically united with Christ (cf. {Rom11:17|Rom. 11:17} and {Rom11:17^1|notes}; {Gal3:26|Gal. 3:26} and {Gal3:26^2|note 2}). This is possible because Christ is the Son of God in two aspects: the aspect of His being the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of His being the firstborn Son of God. In eternity Christ was God&rsquo;s only begotten Son ({Joh3:16|John 3:16}; {1Jo4:9|1&nbsp;John 4:9}), possessing only divinity without humanity. As such, He was unique. However, one day Christ was incarnated to be a man, taking on human nature and joining Himself with humanity ({Joh1:14|John 1:14}). After dying an all-inclusive, vicarious death on the cross, He entered into resurrection. In resurrection and through resurrection He was begotten of God in His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity ({Act13:33|Acts 13:33} and {Act13:33^1|note}; {Rom1:3|Rom. 1:3}-{Rom1:4|4} and {Rom1:3^1|notes}). Hence, in addition to His being the unique, only begotten Son of God from eternity, Christ, after His incarnation and through His resurrection, has become the Son of God in another sense, in the sense of being the firstborn Son of God ({Heb1:5|Heb. 1:5}-{Heb1:6|6}). Furthermore, in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection all His believers were begotten of God, regenerated ({1Pe1:3|1&nbsp;Pet. 1:3}), to be the many sons of God ({Heb2:10|Heb. 2:10}), Christ&rsquo;s many brothers ({Rom8:29|Rom. 8:29}), to be His members for the constituting of His organic Body.

Israel&rsquo;s transformation as described in vv. {Hos14:4|4}-{Hos14:7|7} is based on the factor of love in life (see {Hos11:1^1|note 1<sup>1</sup>} in {Hos11|ch. 11}). Love in affection does not transform, but love in life transforms people through the growth in life. Our relationship with God is of the divine, eternal life of God ({1Jo5:11|1&nbsp;John 5:11}). This life enlivens us, regenerates us, sanctifies us positionally and dispositionally, renews us, transforms us, conforms us, matures us, and glorifies us, making us the same as God in life, nature, appearance, and glory. At the beginning of this book Israel was a harlot, but at the end of this book, Israel has become a son ({Hos11:1|11:1}). Thus, the outcome of this book is transformation in life by God&rsquo;s love (cf. {Rom8:28|Rom. 8:28}-{Rom8:39|39}; {Heb12:5|Heb. 12:5}-{Heb12:10|10})."]},
